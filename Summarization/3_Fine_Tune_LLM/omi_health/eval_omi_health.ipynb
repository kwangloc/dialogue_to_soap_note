Can you tell me about your medical history?\\nPatient: Yes, I have hypertension and lumbar spinal canal stenosis.\\nDoctor: Have you been treated with an oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent for these conditions?\\nPatient: No, I haven't.\\nDoctor: When did you first notice the backache?\\nPatient: The discomfort started about 4 days ago without any obvious cause.\\nDoctor: Has your backache worsened since then?\\nPatient: Yes, it aggravated suddenly, and I also had vomiting and difficulty with body movement.\\nDoctor: Did you seek medical help for these symptoms?\\nPatient: Yes, I visited the Department of Surgery at your hospital and was admitted for examination and treatment.\\nDoctor: Were there any abnormal findings on thoracoabdominal CT or endoscopy from a surgical perspective?\\nPatient: They didn't find anything abnormal, so they referred me to your department.\\nDoctor: Alright, let's discuss your initial examination. Your body temperature was 36.2\\u00b0C, blood pressure was 192/109 mmHg, and pulse was 79/min. You had a mild disturbance of orientation with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of E4, V4, M6. Have you experienced a severe headache along with the backache?\\nPatient: No, just the severe backache.\\nDoctor: Okay. During your neurological examination, we didn't find any hypesthesia or muscle weakness of the lower limbs. Your deep tendon reflexes were normal, and there were no abnormalities in hemorrhage and coagulation test findings. On plain radiography at admission, there were also no abnormal findings in the thoracolumbar vertebrae. We performed a lumbar spinal MRI 4 days after the onset, which showed a band-like shadow continuous from the thoracic spinal level, with high intensity on T1-weighted imaging and low intensity on T2-weighted imaging, and STIR. To examine the lesion at the upper level more closely, we performed a thoracic spinal MRI 7 days after the onset. It revealed a band-like shadow extending from Th2 to L3 on the subdural extramedullary ventral side. A mass was present in the shadow at Th7, compressing and deforming the spinal cord centered on this region, with changes in intramedullary brightness of Th6.\\nPatient: That sounds concerning. What does it mean?\\nDoctor: It indicates that there is a mass compressing your spinal cord which might be causing your backache and other symptoms. We will need to perform further tests and discuss potential treatment options with you.\\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate your help.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\\nPatient: Hi, I'm a 36-year-old gravida 2, para 1 Caucasian woman, and I'm currently 9 weeks pregnant. I've been having headaches lately.\\nDoctor: I see. Are you experiencing any visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, or other neurological symptoms?\\nPatient: No, just the headaches.\\nDoctor: Alright. I understand that your previous in vitro fertilization pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia at 27 weeks of gestation, and you delivered a growth-restricted fetus by cesarean section at 36 weeks, weighing 1900 g. Is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: I also see in your file that you have a past history of infrarenal aortic stenosis, which was diagnosed based on a computed tomographic angiogram. This angiogram was done to investigate your persistent hypertension and intermittent claudication postpartum. It showed 75% stenosis of the infrarenal aorta with hypertrophied internal mammary and epigastric arteries. Is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\\nDoctor: It seems that your regular medications include aspirin 100 mg and calcium 1.2 g daily. Additionally, your family history is significant for paternal ischemic heart disease and maternal hypertension. Is that accurate?\\nPatient: Yes, you've got it right.\\nDoctor: During your pregnancy, laboratory investigations for preeclampsia revealed low-grade proteinuria with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 40 mg/mmol, as well as normal renal and liver function. Your vasculitic screen showed a normal C-reactive protein level of 3.8 mg/L, mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 16 mm/h, and absence of antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and antiphospholipid antibodies. Does that sound correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's what the tests showed.\\nDoctor: At 34 weeks, your ultrasound indicated that the estimated fetal weight was in the 94th percentile, and your placental vascular resistance was normal. Is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. The differential diagnoses for your major finding of significant infrarenal aortic stenosis include congenital abdominal coarctation, Takayasu's arteritis, fibromuscular dysplasia, aortic neurofibromatosis, aortic tuberculosis, and radiation aortitis. In your case, the presence of a well-developed collateral vasculature suggests a chronic aortopathy.\\nPatient: Okay, so what does that mean?\\nDoctor: Since you don't have any clinical history or signs of neurofibromatosis, tuberculosis, or radiation exposure, and there is little evidence of active inflammation, the diagnosis could be chronic abdominal aortopathy from congenital abdominal aortic coarctation, fibromuscular dysplasia, or an inactive form of Takayasu's arteritis. We will need to continue monitoring your condition and possibly adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\\nPatient: I understand. What should I do next?\\nDoctor: We will keep a close eye on your pregnancy and monitor your headaches as well as any potential symptoms related to your aortic stenosis. It is important to continue taking your medications and attending regular check-ups. If you notice any changes in your symptoms or have any concerns, please reach out to us immediately.\\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.\\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don't hesitate to contact us if you need any assistance.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your past medical history?\\nPatient: Hi, I don't have any past medical history.\\nDoctor: Okay. What brings you in today?\\nPatient: I've been experiencing painless blurry vision in my right eye for a week now. I've also had intermittent fevers, headache, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on my lower legs for the past 6 months.\\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. Have you had any other symptoms such as neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, Raynaud's phenomenon, oral ulcerations, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity?\\nPatient: No, only an isolated episode of left knee swelling and testicular swelling in the past.\\nDoctor: Do you work with any toxic substances or have any habits like smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use?\\nPatient: No, I work as a flooring installer and I don't have any toxic habits.\\nDoctor: Alright. We checked your vital signs and they were normal. During the physical exam, we found bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema in your right eye, which was greater than in your left eye. You also have a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect and a right afferent pupillary defect. Your muscle strength and reflexes were normal, and your sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception was intact. We also noticed the maculopapular rash on your bilateral lower extremities.\\nPatient: Oh, I see.\\nDoctor: Your admitting labs showed some abnormal results. You have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 11.6 gm/dL, hematocrit of 35.3%, and mean corpuscular volume of 76.9 fL. You also have hyponatremia with a sodium level of 133 mmol/L. Your erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated at 33 mm/hr, and your C-reactive protein (CRP) is also elevated at 13.3 mg/L. Your urinalysis did not show any protein or blood.\\nPatient: Okay. What does that mean?\\nDoctor: These results could indicate an underlying inflammatory or infectious process. We also performed a lumbar puncture, which showed clear and colorless fluid, 2 red blood cells per microliter, and 56 white blood cells per microliter.\\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\\nDoctor: We need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. We'll run additional tests and consult with a specialist to get a clearer understanding of your condition. In the meantime, we'll monitor your symptoms and provide supportive care. We'll keep you informed about any new findings and discuss the best course of treatment.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you, Doctor.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"S: The patient is a 76-year-old woman presenting with a chief complaint of severe backache that started 4 days ago without an apparent cause. She reports that the pain has worsened suddenly and is accompanied by vomiting and difficulty with body movement. Her medical history includes hypertension and lumbar spinal canal stenosis. She denies using any oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. No severe headache was reported.\\nO: Initial examination showed a body temperature of 36.2\\u00b0C, elevated blood pressure at 192/109 mmHg, and a pulse of 79/min. Neurological examination revealed mild disorientation (GCS: E4, V4, M6) but no hypesthesia or muscle weakness in the lower limbs, and normal deep tendon reflexes. Hemorrhage and coagulation tests were normal. Plain radiography of the thoracolumbar vertebrae showed no abnormalities. Lumbar and thoracic spinal MRI indicated a band-like shadow from Th2 to L3 with a mass at Th7 compressing the spinal cord, suggesting spinal cord compression.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is spinal cord compression due to a mass at Th7, likely causing the patient's backache and associated symptoms. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of spinal cord compression or intrinsic spinal pathology. The prognosis depends on the nature of the mass and response to treatment.\\nP: Plan to perform further diagnostic tests to characterize the mass, including possible biopsy if accessible. Consultation with neurosurgery for potential surgical intervention to relieve spinal cord compression. Manage hypertension aggressively to reduce cardiovascular risks. Continue monitoring neurological status and adjust pain management as needed. Educate the patient on the signs of worsening neurological function and instruct her to report immediately if symptoms progress.

She also has a history of infrarenal aortic stenosis diagnosed postpartum, persistent hypertension, and intermittent claudication. Her regular medications include aspirin 100 mg and calcium 1.2 g daily. Family history is significant for paternal ischemic heart disease and maternal hypertension.\\nO: Past investigations revealed 75% stenosis of the infrarenal aorta on computed tomographic angiogram. Recent laboratory tests during pregnancy showed low-grade proteinuria with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 40 mg/mmol, normal renal and liver function, a C-reactive protein level of 3.8 mg/L, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 16 mm/h, and absence of antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and antiphospholipid antibodies. Ultrasound at 34 weeks indicated an estimated fetal weight in the 94th percentile with normal placental vascular resistance.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is significant infrarenal aortic stenosis with differential diagnoses including congenital abdominal coarctation, Takayasu's arteritis, fibromuscular dysplasia, aortic neurofibromatosis, aortic tuberculosis, and radiation aortitis. The presence of well-developed collateral vasculature suggests a chronic aortopathy, likely due to congenital abdominal aortic coarctation, fibromuscular dysplasia, or an inactive form of Takayasu's arteritis.\\nP: Continue monitoring the patient's pregnancy and headaches, along with potential symptoms related to aortic stenosis.

She reports that the pain has worsened suddenly and is accompanied by vomiting and difficulty with body movement. Her medical history includes hypertension and lumbar spinal canal stenosis. She denies using any oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. No severe headache was reported.\\nO: Initial examination showed a body temperature of 36.2\\u00b0C, elevated blood pressure at 192/109 mmHg, and a pulse of 79/min. Neurological examination revealed mild disorientation (GCS: E4, V4, M6) but no hypesthesia or muscle weakness in the lower limbs, and normal deep tendon reflexes. Hemorrhage and coagulation tests were normal. Plain radiography of the thoracolumbar vertebrae showed no abnormalities. Lumbar and thoracic spinal MRI indicated a band-like shadow from Th2 to L3 with a mass at Th7 compressing the spinal cord, suggesting spinal cord compression.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is spinal cord compression due to a mass at Th7, likely causing the patient's backache and associated symptoms. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of spinal cord compression or intrinsic spinal pathology. The prognosis depends on the nature of the mass and response to treatment.\\nP: Plan to perform further diagnostic tests to characterize the mass, including possible biopsy if accessible. Consultation with neurosurgery for potential surgical intervention to relieve spinal cord compression. Manage hypertension aggressively to reduce cardiovascular risks. Continue monitoring neurological status and adjust pain management as needed. Educate the patient on the signs of worsening neurological function and instruct her to report immediately if symptoms progress. Schedule follow-up appointments to reassess condition and treatment efficacy.\",\n          \"S: The patient is a 36-year-old gravida 2, para 1 Caucasian woman, currently 9 weeks pregnant, presenting with headaches. She denies any visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, or other neurological symptoms. Her medical history includes a previous pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia and delivery of a growth-restricted fetus. She also has a history of infrarenal aortic stenosis diagnosed postpartum, persistent hypertension, and intermittent claudication. Her regular medications include aspirin 100 mg and calcium 1.2 g daily. Family history is significant for paternal ischemic heart disease and maternal hypertension.\\nO: Past investigations revealed 75% stenosis of the infrarenal aorta on computed tomographic angiogram. Recent laboratory tests during pregnancy showed low-grade proteinuria with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 40 mg/mmol, normal renal and liver function, a C-reactive protein level of 3.8 mg/L, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 16 mm/h, and absence of antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and antiphospholipid antibodies. Ultrasound at 34 weeks indicated an estimated fetal weight in the 94th percentile with normal placental vascular resistance.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is significant infrarenal aortic stenosis with differential diagnoses including congenital abdominal coarctation, Takayasu's arteritis, fibromuscular dysplasia, aortic neurofibromatosis, aortic tuberculosis, and radiation aortitis. The presence of well-developed collateral vasculature suggests a chronic aortopathy, likely due to congenital abdominal aortic coarctation, fibromuscular dysplasia, or an inactive form of Takayasu's arteritis.\\nP: Continue monitoring the patient's pregnancy and headaches, along with potential symptoms related to aortic stenosis. Maintain current medication regimen of aspirin and calcium. Regular follow-up appointments are essential to monitor the progression of the aortic condition and manage pregnancy-related complications. The patient is advised to immediately report any new or worsening symptoms.\",\n          \"S: The patient, a flooring installer with no significant past medical history, presents with painless blurry vision in the right eye for one week, intermittent fevers, headaches, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on the lower legs for six months. The patient also reports an isolated episode of left knee and testicular swelling in the past but denies any neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, Raynaud's phenomenon, oral ulcerations, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity. No history of exposure to toxic substances or habits related to smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use.\\nO: Vital signs are normal. Physical examination reveals bilateral papilledema, greater optic nerve erythema in the right eye, a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect, and a right afferent pupillary defect. Muscle strength, reflexes, and sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception are intact. A maculopapular rash is noted on bilateral lower extremities. Lab findings include microcytic anemia (Hemoglobin: 11.6 gm/dL, Hematocrit: 35.3%, MCV: 76.9 fL), hyponatremia (Sodium: 133 mmol/L), elevated ESR (33 mm/hr), and CRP (13.3 mg/L). Urinalysis is normal. Lumbar puncture shows clear fluid, 2 RBCs/\\u00b5L, and 56 WBCs/\\u00b5L.\\nA: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious process affecting multiple systems, including the central nervous system, as indicated by papilledema and abnormal lumbar puncture results. Differential diagnoses could include autoimmune conditions, infectious diseases, or other systemic inflammatory disorders. The presence of optic nerve involvement and systemic symptoms necessitates further investigation to narrow down the causes.\\nP: Plan to conduct additional diagnostic tests to explore underlying causes, including imaging studies and specific serological tests. Consultation with a neurologist and possibly a rheumatologist or infectious disease specialist is recommended. Monitor the patient's symptoms closely and provide supportive care as needed. Educate the patient about the findings and the importance of follow-up for further evaluation and management. Ensure the patient understands the potential seriousness of the symptoms and the need for thorough investigation and possibly long-term management.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"fine_tuned_model_output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 14,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"S: The patient, diagnosed with HHH syndrome at age 4, reports a history of seizures and abnormal neurological findings, including expressive language and attention deficits. The patient has significant myopia and was on a protein-restricted diet (1.5 g/kg/d) during childhood. The patient's weight has been at the 25th percentile, and height below the 3rd percentile. The patient had three pregnancies, with complications including mild hyperammonemia and seizures during the second pregnancy, leading to the administration of carbamazepine. The patient's second child had elevated ornithine levels post-birth, treated with oral sodium benzoate and intravenous arginine. The third child experienced transient respiratory distress at birth.\\nO: The patient's past medical records indicate multiple small calcifications in the brain, normal cerebral angiography, and fluctuating ammonia levels managed with medication. The patient's children have shown normal growth and development post-birth, except for the second child's elevated ornithine levels and the third child's transient respiratory distress.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is HHH syndrome, characterized by hyperornithinemia, hyperammonemia, and severe mental retardation. Differential diagnoses could include other metabolic disorders, but the patient's history and biochemical profile support the primary diagnosis. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the normal development of the children and management of metabolic disturbances, though the risk of neurological complications remains.\\nP: Continue the current diet and medication regimen, including carbamazepine for seizure management. Regular follow-ups with neurology and metabolic specialists are recommended to monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment as necessary. Genetic counseling for the patient and family may be beneficial to discuss the hereditary nature of HHH syndrome and potential implications for future offspring. Educate the patient on the importance of adherence to the dietary restrictions and medication to prevent metabolic crises.\",\n          \"S: The patient, a middle-aged adult, presented with difficulty walking that started three days ago, initially experiencing discomfort in the front of the knee, which progressed to pain the following day. The patient denied any injury or specific event leading to the symptoms. No swelling was noted. The patient reported a temporary relief of symptoms following an intra-articular injection of xylocaine, but subsequently developed a catching sensation in the knee.\\nO: Physical examination revealed no tenderness at the medial and lateral femorotibial joint and negative results for the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, varus/valgus instability, and McMurray test. Radiographs showed no abnormalities, while MRI indicated a soft tissue mass near the knee joint with high signal intensities on T1- and T2-weighted images, low signal intensity on fat-suppressed images, and no contrast enhancement. Blood tests were normal. Surgical intervention confirmed the presence of a large fat mass with mobility on the anterior surface of the proximal-lateral PF joint, composed mainly of connective tissue and fatty tissue. Histological examination ruled out lipoma, lipoma arborescens, and pigmented villonodular synovitis.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is a benign soft tissue mass near the knee joint, likely contributing to the patient's symptoms of pain and catching sensation. Differential diagnoses such as lipoma, lipoma arborescens, and pigmented villonodular synovitis were considered but ruled out based on histological findings.\\nP: The patient underwent successful knee arthroscopy with resection of the fat mass. Post-operative recovery has been good with resolution of anterior knee pain and catching sensation. The patient is advised to follow up for monitoring of symptoms and to ensure no recurrence. Further consultations with orthopedic specialists may be necessary if symptoms reappear or new symptoms develop.\",\n          \"S: The patient reports experiencing painless blurry vision in the right eye for one week, accompanied by intermittent fevers, headache, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on the lower legs for the past 6 months. The patient denies any history of toxic substance exposure, smoking, drinking, illicit drug use, and has no significant past medical history except for isolated episodes of left knee and testicular swelling.\\nO: Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema, more pronounced in the right eye. The patient has a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect and a right afferent pupillary defect. Muscle strength and reflexes are normal, and sensory examination is intact. Laboratory findings include microcytic anemia (hemoglobin 11.6 gm/dL, hematocrit 35.3%, MCV 76.9 fL), hyponatremia (sodium 133 mmol/L), elevated ESR (33 mm/hr), and CRP (13.3 mg/L). Urinalysis is normal. Lumbar puncture shows clear, colorless fluid with 2 RBCs/\\u00b5L and 56 WBCs/\\u00b5L.\\nA: The differential diagnosis includes inflammatory or infectious conditions, possibly autoimmune or paraneoplastic syndromes, given the optic neuropathy, rash, and systemic symptoms. The presence of papilledema and optic nerve erythema raises concerns for increased intracranial pressure or inflammatory optic neuropathy.\\nP: Plan to conduct further diagnostic tests including imaging studies (MRI of the brain and orbit) and additional laboratory tests to explore underlying causes. Consult neurology and rheumatology for expert evaluation. Monitor vital signs and neurological status closely. Educate the patient on the importance of follow-up and adherence to the proposed diagnostic plan.
