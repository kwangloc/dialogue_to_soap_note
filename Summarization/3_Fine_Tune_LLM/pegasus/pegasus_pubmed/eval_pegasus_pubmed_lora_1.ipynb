Can you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing on your right side?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having this pain in my right upper abdomen, and it's been quite bothersome.\\nDoctor: Hmm, it sounds like you may have a positive Murphy's sign. You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what does that mean for me?\\nDoctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?\\nDoctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. During the procedure, we placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.\\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\\nDoctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?\\nDoctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the ARHD, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.\\nPatient: So, what was done during the surgery?\\nDoctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.\\nPatient: How was the ARHD removed?\\nDoctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. What should I expect during my recovery?\\nDoctor: You will need to follow up with us regularly so we can monitor your progress and ensure proper healing. Make sure to follow any post-operative instructions and contact us if you experience any unusual symptoms or concerns.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dysphagia and significant body weight loss over the past 3 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've had trouble swallowing and I lost around 10 kg in the past 3 months. It's been really tough.\\nDoctor: I see. I've noted that your height is 158.0 cm and your current weight is 53.6 kg. Upon admission, your body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 21.5. Besides this, you also have osteoporosis, which causes you to be bent over. You underwent distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I had the surgery a long time ago.\\nDoctor: According to your operative note, the surgery was performed without lymph node dissection. After the retroperitoneal attachments behind the duodenum were dissected, a Billroth I reconstruction was performed. The resected mass was determined to be an aberrant pancreas. \\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\\nDoctor: We performed an upper gastrointestinal examination and found the presence of your postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed that esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract were absent, which is good news.\\nPatient: Oh, that's a relief.\\nDoctor: However, enhanced computed tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the mediastinum. The stomach was expanded with food remaining inside, and it was compressing the heart in the posterior mediastinum. \\nPatient: That sounds serious.\\nDoctor: It is a concern, but fortunately, you have no symptoms of cardiac failure, and your heart function was normal on echocardiography. Preoperative eCT also showed that the right and left gastric arteries and the gastroepiploic arteries were preserved, which indicates that the distal gastrectomy was performed without lymph node dissection. \\nPatient: So what's the next step, doc?\\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and the hiatal hernia diagnosis, your dysphagia is quite severe, so we recommend elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia to alleviate your symptoms.\\nPatient: Alright, if that's what's needed.\\nDoctor: During the surgery, a total of five ports will be placed in your abdomen, and a Nathanson liver retractor will be inserted to retract the left liver lobe. A laparoscopic approach will be used to address the slight adhesion of the greater omentum just under the postoperative scar and the little adhesion with the liver and spleen.\\nPatient: Okay, I understand. When will the surgery be scheduled?\\nDoctor: We'll work on scheduling the surgery as soon as possible and inform you of the date. In the meantime, please follow any preoperative instructions provided by our staff, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\\nPatient: Hi, I've been experiencing constant blurry vision in my left eye for about 6 weeks now.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?\\nPatient: Yeah, I have cystic fibrosis, which has led to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic sinusitis, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.\\nDoctor: Have you had any surgeries in the past?\\nPatient: I had sinus surgery about 7 months ago. It involved bilateral maxillary antrostomies, ethmoidectomies, sphenoidectomies, and frontal sinusotomies.\\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking?\\nPatient: I'm taking albuterol, azithromycin, itraconazole, insulin, lisinopril, pancreatic enzymes, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.\\nDoctor: Do you use tobacco or any drugs?\\nPatient: No, I don't.\\nDoctor: Alright. At the time of presentation, your visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, intraocular pressure was 18 OD and 16 OS, and your pupils were 4 mm and reactive in both eyes. Your anterior exam was unremarkable, but your posterior exam in the left eye showed intraretinal hemorrhages along the nerve fiber layer with associated retinal thickening in the inferior macula, consistent with a BRVO.\\nPatient: Oh, I see.\\nDoctor: We also performed optical coherence tomography which revealed mild intraretinal and trace subfoveal fluid in your left eye. These findings were confirmed with a fluorescein angiogram, which showed delayed venous filling in the inferior venous arcade.\\nPatient: Okay, so what does that mean?\\nDoctor: It means there might be an issue with the blood vessels in your eye. Your blood pressure readings have been consistently between 110 and 145 systolic over 70-85 diastolic in the past year, and your most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.9% 4 months prior to presentation.

Can you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing on your right side?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having this pain in my right upper abdomen, and it's been quite bothersome.\\nDoctor: Hmm, it sounds like you may have a positive Murphy's sign. You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what does that mean for me?\\nDoctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?\\nDoctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. During the procedure, we placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.\\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\\nDoctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?\\nDoctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the ARHD, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.\\nPatient: So, what was done during the surgery?\\nDoctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.\\nPatient: How was the ARHD removed?\\nDoctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. What should I expect during my recovery?\\nDoctor: You will need to follow up with us regularly so we can monitor your progress and ensure proper healing. Make sure to follow any post-operative instructions and contact us if you experience any unusual symptoms or concerns.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dysphagia and significant body weight loss over the past 3 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've had trouble swallowing and I lost around 10 kg in the past 3 months. It's been really tough.\\nDoctor: I see. I've noted that your height is 158.0 cm and your current weight is 53.6 kg. Upon admission, your body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 21.5. Besides this, you also have osteoporosis, which causes you to be bent over. You underwent distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I had the surgery a long time ago.\\nDoctor: According to your operative note, the surgery was performed without lymph node dissection. After the retroperitoneal attachments behind the duodenum were dissected, a Billroth I reconstruction was performed. The resected mass was determined to be an aberrant pancreas. \\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\\nDoctor: We performed an upper gastrointestinal examination and found the presence of your postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed that esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract were absent, which is good news.\\nPatient: Oh, that's a relief.\\nDoctor: However, enhanced computed tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the mediastinum. The stomach was expanded with food remaining inside, and it was compressing the heart in the posterior mediastinum. \\nPatient: That sounds serious.\\nDoctor: It is a concern, but fortunately, you have no symptoms of cardiac failure, and your heart function was normal on echocardiography. Preoperative eCT also showed that the right and left gastric arteries and the gastroepiploic arteries were preserved, which indicates that the distal gastrectomy was performed without lymph node dissection. \\nPatient: So what's the next step, doc?\\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and the hiatal hernia diagnosis, your dysphagia is quite severe, so we recommend elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia to alleviate your symptoms.\\nPatient: Alright, if that's what's needed.\\nDoctor: During the surgery, a total of five ports will be placed in your abdomen, and a Nathanson liver retractor will be inserted to retract the left liver lobe. A laparoscopic approach will be used to address the slight adhesion of the greater omentum just under the postoperative scar and the little adhesion with the liver and spleen.\\nPatient: Okay, I understand. When will the surgery be scheduled?\\nDoctor: We'll work on scheduling the surgery as soon as possible and inform you of the date. In the meantime, please follow any preoperative instructions provided by our staff, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\\nPatient: Hi, I've been experiencing constant blurry vision in my left eye for about 6 weeks now.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?\\nPatient: Yeah, I have cystic fibrosis, which has led to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic sinusitis, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.\\nDoctor: Have you had any surgeries in the past?\\nPatient: I had sinus surgery about 7 months ago. It involved bilateral maxillary antrostomies, ethmoidectomies, sphenoidectomies, and frontal sinusotomies.\\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking?\\nPatient: I'm taking albuterol, azithromycin, itraconazole, insulin, lisinopril, pancreatic enzymes, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.\\nDoctor: Do you use tobacco or any drugs?\\nPatient: No, I don't.\\nDoctor: Alright. At the time of presentation, your visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, intraocular pressure was 18 OD and 16 OS, and your pupils were 4 mm and reactive in both eyes. Your anterior exam was unremarkable, but your posterior exam in the left eye showed intraretinal hemorrhages along the nerve fiber layer with associated retinal thickening in the inferior macula, consistent with a BRVO.\\nPatient: Oh, I see.\\nDoctor: We also performed optical coherence tomography which revealed mild intraretinal and trace subfoveal fluid in your left eye. These findings were confirmed with a fluorescein angiogram, which showed delayed venous filling in the inferior venous arcade.\\nPatient: Okay, so what does that mean?\\nDoctor: It means there might be an issue with the blood vessels in your eye. Your blood pressure readings have been consistently between 110 and 145 systolic over 70-85 diastolic in the past year, and your most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.9% 4 months prior to presentation. We also did a laboratory workup.\\nPatient: What did the lab results show?\\nDoctor: The complete blood cell count, Vitamin A and D levels, prothrombin time, thrombin time, antithrombin activity, Protein C and S activity, cardiolipins, dilute Russell's viper venom time, homocysteine level, and a negative prothrombin G20210A mutation were all normal. Your complete metabolic panel showed a mild elevation in glucose of 121 mg/dL, and your antinuclear antibody was weakly elevated at 2.\\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\\nDoctor: The results indicate that there might be an issue with your blood vessels related to your blurry vision. We will need to monitor your blood pressure and glucose levels closely and consider further testing or treatment options based on your progress.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you for the information.\\nDoctor: You're welcome.
