Can you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing on your right side?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having this pain in my right upper abdomen, and it's been quite bothersome.\\nDoctor: Hmm, it sounds like you may have a positive Murphy's sign. You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what does that mean for me?\\nDoctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?\\nDoctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. During the procedure, we placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.\\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\\nDoctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?\\nDoctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the ARHD, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.\\nPatient: So, what was done during the surgery?\\nDoctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.\\nPatient: How was the ARHD removed?\\nDoctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. What should I expect during my recovery?\\nDoctor: You will need to follow up with us regularly so we can monitor your progress and ensure proper healing. Make sure to follow any post-operative instructions and contact us if you experience any unusual symptoms or concerns.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dysphagia and significant body weight loss over the past 3 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've had trouble swallowing and I lost around 10 kg in the past 3 months. It's been really tough.\\nDoctor: I see. I've noted that your height is 158.0 cm and your current weight is 53.6 kg. Upon admission, your body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 21.5. Besides this, you also have osteoporosis, which causes you to be bent over. You underwent distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I had the surgery a long time ago.\\nDoctor: According to your operative note, the surgery was performed without lymph node dissection. After the retroperitoneal attachments behind the duodenum were dissected, a Billroth I reconstruction was performed. The resected mass was determined to be an aberrant pancreas. \\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\\nDoctor: We performed an upper gastrointestinal examination and found the presence of your postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed that esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract were absent, which is good news.\\nPatient: Oh, that's a relief.\\nDoctor: However, enhanced computed tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the mediastinum. The stomach was expanded with food remaining inside, and it was compressing the heart in the posterior mediastinum. \\nPatient: That sounds serious.\\nDoctor: It is a concern, but fortunately, you have no symptoms of cardiac failure, and your heart function was normal on echocardiography. Preoperative eCT also showed that the right and left gastric arteries and the gastroepiploic arteries were preserved, which indicates that the distal gastrectomy was performed without lymph node dissection. \\nPatient: So what's the next step, doc?\\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and the hiatal hernia diagnosis, your dysphagia is quite severe, so we recommend elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia to alleviate your symptoms.\\nPatient: Alright, if that's what's needed.\\nDoctor: During the surgery, a total of five ports will be placed in your abdomen, and a Nathanson liver retractor will be inserted to retract the left liver lobe. A laparoscopic approach will be used to address the slight adhesion of the greater omentum just under the postoperative scar and the little adhesion with the liver and spleen.\\nPatient: Okay, I understand. When will the surgery be scheduled?\\nDoctor: We'll work on scheduling the surgery as soon as possible and inform you of the date. In the meantime, please follow any preoperative instructions provided by our staff, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\\nPatient: Hi, I've been experiencing constant blurry vision in my left eye for about 6 weeks now.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?\\nPatient: Yeah, I have cystic fibrosis, which has led to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic sinusitis, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.\\nDoctor: Have you had any surgeries in the past?\\nPatient: I had sinus surgery about 7 months ago. It involved bilateral maxillary antrostomies, ethmoidectomies, sphenoidectomies, and frontal sinusotomies.\\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking?\\nPatient: I'm taking albuterol, azithromycin, itraconazole, insulin, lisinopril, pancreatic enzymes, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.\\nDoctor: Do you use tobacco or any drugs?\\nPatient: No, I don't.\\nDoctor: Alright. At the time of presentation, your visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, intraocular pressure was 18 OD and 16 OS, and your pupils were 4 mm and reactive in both eyes. Your anterior exam was unremarkable, but your posterior exam in the left eye showed intraretinal hemorrhages along the nerve fiber layer with associated retinal thickening in the inferior macula, consistent with a BRVO.\\nPatient: Oh, I see.\\nDoctor: We also performed optical coherence tomography which revealed mild intraretinal and trace subfoveal fluid in your left eye. These findings were confirmed with a fluorescein angiogram, which showed delayed venous filling in the inferior venous arcade.\\nPatient: Okay, so what does that mean?\\nDoctor: It means there might be an issue with the blood vessels in your eye. Your blood pressure readings have been consistently between 110 and 145 systolic over 70-85 diastolic in the past year, and your most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.9% 4 months prior to presentation. We also did a laboratory workup.\\nPatient: What did the lab results show?\\nDoctor: The complete blood cell count, Vitamin A and D levels, prothrombin time, thrombin time, antithrombin activity, Protein C and S activity, cardiolipins, dilute Russell's viper venom time, homocysteine level, and a negative prothrombin G20210A mutation were all normal. Your complete metabolic panel showed a mild elevation in glucose of 121 mg/dL, and your antinuclear antibody was weakly elevated at 2.\\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\\nDoctor: The results indicate that there might be an issue with your blood vessels related to your blurry vision. We will need to monitor your blood pressure and glucose levels closely and consider further testing or treatment options based on your progress.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you for the information.\\nDoctor: You're welcome.

The patient has a history of cholelithiasis and was referred for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment.\\nO: Physical examination suggested a positive Murphy's sign. CT scan without contrast showed a gallstone in a thickened gallbladder wall and surrounding panniculitis. MRCP revealed an aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle and an aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) draining into the cystic duct were noted. Intraoperative cholangiography confirmed ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.\\nA: The patient was diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with an aberrant bile duct connection. The presence of ARHD and its drainage pattern were confirmed during surgery, which required removal due to lack of confluence with major intrahepatic bile ducts.\\nP: The patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with removal and ligation of the ARHD.

The patient also has osteoporosis.\\nO: Current height is 158.0 cm, weight is 53.6 kg, and BMI is 21.5. Upper gastrointestinal examination showed postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity and absence of esophagitis and tumors in the upper digestive tract. Enhanced computed tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia with the entire stomach sliding into the mediastinum, compressing the heart, but no symptoms of cardiac failure were observed. Heart function is normal as per echocardiography.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is a large hiatal hernia causing severe dysphagia and weight loss. The patient's previous surgical history and current imaging support the diagnosis. Differential diagnoses such as esophagitis and tumors in the upper digestive tract have been ruled out.\\nP: Plan to perform elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia using a laparoscopic approach with five abdominal ports and a Nathanson liver retractor. Preoperative instructions will be provided, and surgery will be scheduled promptly. The patient is advised to follow preoperative guidelines and reach out with any questions or concerns.\",\n          \"S: Patient reports constant blurry vision in the left eye for approximately 6 weeks. Medical history includes cystic fibrosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic sinusitis, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Denies use of tobacco or drugs.\\nO: Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes. Intraocular pressure is 18 OD and 16 OS. Pupils are 4 mm and reactive bilaterally. Anterior eye exam unremarkable. Posterior exam of the left eye reveals intraretinal hemorrhages along the nerve fiber layer with retinal thickening in the inferior macula, consistent with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). Optical coherence tomography shows mild intraretinal and trace subfoveal fluid in the left eye. Fluorescein angiogram indicates delayed venous filling in the inferior venous arcade. Blood pressure readings over the past year range from 110/70 to 145/85. Recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.9%. Laboratory workup shows normal complete blood cell count, Vitamin A and D levels, coagulation profiles, and negative prothrombin G20210A mutation. Mild elevation in glucose at 121 mg/dL and weakly positive antinuclear antibody at 2.\\nA: Primary diagnosis is branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) in the left eye, likely exacerbated by underlying hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Differential diagnoses could include diabetic retinopathy or other vascular occlusive disorders. The prognosis depends on the management of underlying conditions and response to treatment.\\nP: Plan to monitor blood pressure and glucose levels closely. Initiate or adjust antihypertensive and diabetic medications as needed. Refer to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and possible intravitreal injections or laser therapy for BRVO. Educate patient on the importance of controlling blood pressure and blood sugar levels to prevent progression of ocular and systemic complications.

Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media showed a slight increase in CT value due to surrounding panniculitis. Medical Review Council of the Philippines (MRCP) confirmed chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed to address the issue. The rightmost rightmost duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed due to inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle. Intraoperative cholangiography showed the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct. A: The primary diagnosis is chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of gallbladder disease, but these are less likely given the surgical intervention and the patient's history of cholelithiasis.

Can you please tell me what concerns you have about your skin?\\nPatient: Yeah, I have this brown papule on my upper back, and it's within a large tattoo. I'm not really sure how long it's been there or if it was there when I got the tattoo.\\nDoctor: I see. Let me take a closer look. Hmm, it appears to be an 8-millimeter flat, brown papule. Since we're uncertain about the lesion's initial presentation, pattern of growth, and appearance, I would recommend a shave removal of the lesion to examine it further. How does that sound?\\nPatient: Okay, I guess that sounds fine.\\n[After the shave removal and excision]\\nDoctor: We have examined the original excision, and it showed an atypical intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation. The dermis also contained scattered foci of tattoo pigment and fibrosis. It's important to note that an early evolving melanoma in situ couldn't be excluded at that time.\\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\\nDoctor: Don't worry, we took further action by re-excising the lesion with a 5-millimeter margin. Upon examination, no residual melanocytic lesion was detected, only scar tissue was present. This is a positive sign.\\nPatient: That's a relief. So what's next?\\nDoctor: You have healed well since the excision, and we will continue to monitor your skin to ensure there are no further concerns. It's important to keep an eye on any changes in your skin and report them to us.\\nPatient: Alright, I'll make sure to pay attention to my skin and let you know if I notice anything unusual.\\nDoctor: That's great. Remember, early detection and intervention are key to managing any potential issues. If you have any concerns or questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.\\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care and have a great day!\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 68-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, newly-diagnosed liver cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I. You were admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology service for a planned transvaginal hysterectomy. Can you tell me more about your medical history and any current symptoms you're experiencing?\\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I don't have any history of significant alcohol use, and my viral hepatitis serologies were negative for hepatitis A, B, and C.\\nDoctor: I noticed that your ferritin level was 319 ng/ml, which makes hemochromatosis unlikely. Your anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies were also negative. So, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are unlikely in the absence of other clinical findings. We also considered Wilson's disease, but your serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal, and you did not have any psychiatric symptoms.\\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. I also remember that my \\u03b1-1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mg/dl.\\nDoctor: Based on your medical history, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) seems to be the most probable explanation for your cirrhosis, given that you have type 2 diabetes mellitus, a body mass index (BMI) of 29.83, and hyperlipidemia. However, you've been taking methotrexate for more than 10 years for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, which could also be a contributing factor.\\nPatient: Hmm, I see. So what happened during my preoperative evaluation?\\nDoctor: During the evaluation, your resting supine oxygen saturation was noted to be 93%. At that time, you denied any respiratory or cardiac symptoms, so you underwent the transvaginal hysterectomy, which went smoothly with no complications.\\nPatient: That's good to hear. But I remember feeling short of breath after the surgery.\\nDoctor: Yes, on postoperative day two, you became dyspneic while walking to the restroom. We also noted a two-gram drop in your hemoglobin level after surgery, which was promptly corrected with two units of packed red blood cells.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. Did that help with my shortness of breath?\\nDoctor: Unfortunately, despite the administration of packed red blood cell transfusions, you still experienced hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82% while sitting up and during ambulation. When you tried to ambulate further, you developed perioral cyanosis.\\nPatient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. What should I do now, Doctor?\\nDoctor: We will continue to closely monitor your condition and provide necessary medical support. It's important that you report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. We will work together to ensure your recovery and to manage your various health conditions.\\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, I see you've come in for an outpatient consultation regarding painful right upper thoracic radiculopathy. Can you tell me how long you've been experiencing this pain?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've been dealing with this pain for about 18 months now. It's been pretty bad.\\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain, how would you rate your pain?\\nPatient: I'd say it's around a 7 or 8 out of 10.\\nDoctor: Have you found anything that helps relieve the pain?\\nPatient: Yes, I've been taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and they seem to help.\\nDoctor: Good to know. Do you have any muscle contracture or pain when I press on the area?\\nPatient: No, I don't have any contracture, and it doesn't hurt when you press on it.\\nDoctor: Can you show me exactly where the pain is located?\\nPatient: It's about 3 cm from the thoracic midline on the right side, and I feel some intercostal irradiation too.\\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. Based on the radiographs we took, we didn't find any osteolysis or deformity. However, the MRI showed a T2 hypersignal and a T1 hyposignal at the medial side of your right T1 vertebra, along with inflammation of the right T1 root. The radioisotope bone scanning also revealed lateral hyperfixation on the right side of your T1 vertebra.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\\nDoctor: The CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of your right T1 pedicle. The lesion is close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve, which is causing the inflammation and pain you're experiencing. The aspect of the lesion is compatible with a condition called osteoid osteoma.\\nPatient: What can be done about it?\\nDoctor: Our team recommends a surgical resection using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance. Because the lesion is so close to the dura mater, we cannot perform radiofrequency ablation, which would require thermal ablation. The surgery should be safe and complete, with no risk of recurrence. We'll also make sure to preserve the vertebral stability without needing screw fixation.\\nPatient: What should I expect during the surgery?\\nDoctor: You'll be in a prone position under general anesthesia. We'll use a new all-in-one imaging device called Surgivisio\\u00ae to control the vertebral level in two-dimensional (2D) mode. This machine is a 2D/3D C-arm designed to be combined with surgical navigation. We'll perform a mini-open posterior approach at the C7-T2 levels.\\nPatient: Thank you for explaining all of this to me. I feel more comfortable knowing what to expect.\\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to make the procedure as smooth and successful as possible.

Despite this, she developed hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82% while sitting up and during ambulation, and perioral cyanosis on further ambulation.\\nA: Primary diagnosis is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, potentially exacerbated by long-term methotrexate use. Postoperative complications include significant hypoxemia and potential anemia. Differential diagnoses for her respiratory symptoms could include pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or pneumonia.\\nP: Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and hemoglobin levels. Consider further diagnostic workup for postoperative respiratory distress, including chest X-ray and possibly a CT pulmonary angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism. Ensure adequate oxygenation and consider respiratory support if hypoxemia persists. Educate the patient on the importance of reporting new or worsening symptoms.

Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\\nPatient: Yes, the pain gets worse after eating, and I also experience abdominal distension, belching, and reduced flatus.\\nDoctor: Have you tried any treatments for these symptoms before coming here?\\nPatient: I was taking some traditional Chinese medicine that temporarily relieved the symptoms.\\nDoctor: I see. Do you have any medical history we should know about?\\nPatient: Yes, I have a history of hypertension, but my control has been poor.\\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. It looks like you underwent a colonoscopy examination in a local hospital. What were the results of that examination?\\nPatient: They verbally reported no pathologic findings.\\nDoctor: Alright, during your physical examination here, we found mesogastric tenderness and an enlarged spleen. Your blood laboratory examination reported only mild hypokalemia, and your urinary and stool reports were normal. Enhanced computerized tomography showed splenomegaly, jejunal wall edema, narrowed lumen, enlarged lymph nodes, mesenteric edema, atrophy of the right liver lobe, hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, calcification, and periportal fibrosis. These signs are compatible with hepatic schistosomiasis.\\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious.\\nDoctor: Yes, it is a condition that needs attention. During the double balloon enteroscopy, we noticed that your blood pressure was not stable, so we couldn't reexamine the colon. The upper enteroscopy showed an ulcer 150 cm distal to the Treitz ligament, measuring 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The ulcer had a white coating and peripheral mucosal hyperemia, occupying 2/3 of the lumen, making it difficult for the endoscope to pass through. We took four biopsies from the ulcer, and 20 cm proximal from the ulcer, we found many scattered irregular ulcers, from which we took two biopsies.\\nPatient: What did the histopathological examination reveal?\\nDoctor: The examination reported chronic jejunal inflammation with ulcerative changes and old S. japonicum eggs deposition.\\nPatient: What treatment did I receive during my hospitalization?\\nDoctor: You received symptomatic treatment with intravenous fluids, electrolytes, antispasmodic medication, and proton-pump inhibitors.\\nPatient: I remember now. Unfortunately, I had to request a voluntary discharge from the hospital and decided to continue my treatment and follow-up at a local hospital.\\nDoctor: It's important to continue your treatment and follow-up, even if it's at a different hospital. Please make sure to keep your appointments and monitor your symptoms closely. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\\nPatient: Hi, I've been having trouble swallowing for about 4 months now.\\nDoctor: I see. Has this been accompanied by any pain?\\nPatient: No, there's been no pain.\\nDoctor: Have you experienced any haemoptysis, or coughing up blood?\\nPatient: No, I haven't.\\nDoctor: Are there any other symptoms or signs you'd like to report?\\nPatient: No, that's about it.\\nDoctor: Alright, let me perform a clinical examination to see if I can identify the issue. Please open your mouth and say \\\"ahh.\\\"\\nPatient: Ahh.\\nDoctor: Upon examination, I found a bulky mass localized to your left tonsillar bed. However, there is no presence of mucosal ulceration.\\nPatient: Oh, what does that mean?\\nDoctor: It means that there is a growth in your tonsil area, but there is no ulceration in the mucous membrane. Additionally, there is no clinical evidence of any pathological cervical lymph nodes.\\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\\nDoctor: I would like to schedule a maxillofacial CT scan and an MRI for further evaluation.\\nPatient: Okay, when should I schedule those?\\nDoctor: As soon as possible, so we can determine the cause of your dysphagia and devise an appropriate treatment plan.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you for your help.\\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll discuss the results of the CT scan and MRI once they're complete, and determine the best course of action.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hi there, can you please tell me what brings you here today?\\nPatient: Well, I've had a history of intermittent, severe epigastric pain.\\nDoctor: I see. How long have you been experiencing this pain?\\nPatient: It's been happening for the past 5 months. The pain usually comes 15-30 minutes after every meal, but it's less severe and goes away on its own.\\nDoctor: Okay, let's review your test results. Your full blood count, serum biochemistry values, and C-reactive protein level are within normal ranges. Your arterial gas analysis is also normal. However, your abdominal plain radiography showed free air between the liver and diaphragm, and PI (Fig.). Additionally, abdominal computed tomography showed severe calcification of the SMA origin; SMA peripheral flow was reserved (Fig.). Computed tomography (CT) revealed bubble-like intramural gas of the small bowel with the contrasted wall pneumoperitoneum (Fig.).\\nPatient: Hmm, that sounds concerning. What does that all mean?\\nDoctor: Since you don't have peritonitis, we decided to take a conservative approach. We managed your condition in the intensive care unit due to potential risks of acute mesenteric ischemia from mesenteric artery occlusion or non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia. You were treated for bowel obstruction, which included fasting and intravenous fluid administration. You also received heparin infusion to prevent SMA occlusion and maintain collateral flow.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. I actually felt some relief from my abdominal pain during my stay in the ICU.\\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Seven days after admission, your abdominal plain radiography showed improvement in PI and pneumoperitoneum. So, we allowed you to start drinking fluids. Did you experience any pain after consuming fluids?\\nPatient: No, I didn't have any recurrent abdominal pain after drinking fluids.\\nDoctor: Great. Since there was no pain, we allowed you to eat solid food as well. Now, we had planned an angiography to further investigate and potentially relieve your postprandial abdominal pain. The findings showed severe stenosis of the SMA origin with calcification, and the SMA had replaced the common hepatic artery (Fig., ). We performed ET, namely stenting to the SMA and common hepatic artery.\\nPatient: How was the procedure done?\\nDoctor: We engaged the SMA trunk with a 6F Parent Plus 60 guiding catheter (Medikit, Tokyo, Japan) from your left brachial artery. Initially, we infused 8000 units of heparin, and added additional heparin to keep your activated whole blood clotting time over 200 seconds.\\nPatient: I see. So, what's next for me?\\nDoctor: Now that the procedure is done, we will continue to monitor your condition closely. It's essential to maintain a proper diet and follow up with your appointments regularly. If you notice any recurrence of abdominal pain or any new symptoms, please contact us immediately.\\nPatient: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will follow your advice and keep an eye on my condition.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reference_summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"S: The patient reports a history of left quadrant abdominal pain worsening postprandially, accompanied by abdominal distension, belching, and reduced flatus.

Enhanced CT indicated splenomegaly, jejunal wall edema, narrowed lumen, enlarged lymph nodes, mesenteric edema, atrophy of the right liver lobe, hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, calcification, and periportal fibrosis, suggesting hepatic schistosomiasis. Double balloon enteroscopy was limited due to unstable blood pressure; however, upper enteroscopy revealed a significant ulcer in the jejunum and multiple scattered irregular ulcers. Histopathology confirmed chronic jejunal inflammation with ulcerative changes and old S. japonicum eggs deposition.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is hepatic schistosomiasis with associated chronic jejunal inflammation and ulceration. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of chronic abdominal pain and malabsorption, but imaging and histopathology strongly support schistosomiasis. The prognosis depends on effective management of the infection and associated complications.\\nP: The patient received symptomatic treatment with intravenous fluids, electrolytes, antispasmodic medication, and proton-pump inhibitors during hospitalization. The patient opted for voluntary discharge and plans to continue treatment and follow-up at a local hospital. It is crucial to maintain consistent follow-up, monitor symptoms, and adhere to prescribed treatments. Referral to an infectious disease specialist for schistosomiasis management and a gastroenterologist for ongoing care of jejunal ulcers is recommended.
