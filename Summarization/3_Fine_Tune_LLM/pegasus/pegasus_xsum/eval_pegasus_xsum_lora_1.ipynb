Can you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing on your right side?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having this pain in my right upper abdomen, and it's been quite bothersome.\\nDoctor: Hmm, it sounds like you may have a positive Murphy's sign. You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what does that mean for me?\\nDoctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?\\nDoctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. During the procedure, we placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.\\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\\nDoctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?\\nDoctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the ARHD, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.\\nPatient: So, what was done during the surgery?\\nDoctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.\\nPatient: How was the ARHD removed?\\nDoctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. What should I expect during my recovery?\\nDoctor: You will need to follow up with us regularly so we can monitor your progress and ensure proper healing. Make sure to follow any post-operative instructions and contact us if you experience any unusual symptoms or concerns.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dysphagia and significant body weight loss over the past 3 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've had trouble swallowing and I lost around 10 kg in the past 3 months. It's been really tough.\\nDoctor: I see. I've noted that your height is 158.0 cm and your current weight is 53.6 kg. Upon admission, your body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 21.5. Besides this, you also have osteoporosis, which causes you to be bent over. You underwent distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I had the surgery a long time ago.\\nDoctor: According to your operative note, the surgery was performed without lymph node dissection. After the retroperitoneal attachments behind the duodenum were dissected, a Billroth I reconstruction was performed. The resected mass was determined to be an aberrant pancreas. \\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\\nDoctor: We performed an upper gastrointestinal examination and found the presence of your postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed that esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract were absent, which is good news.\\nPatient: Oh, that's a relief.\\nDoctor: However, enhanced computed tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the mediastinum. The stomach was expanded with food remaining inside, and it was compressing the heart in the posterior mediastinum. \\nPatient: That sounds serious.\\nDoctor: It is a concern, but fortunately, you have no symptoms of cardiac failure, and your heart function was normal on echocardiography. Preoperative eCT also showed that the right and left gastric arteries and the gastroepiploic arteries were preserved, which indicates that the distal gastrectomy was performed without lymph node dissection. \\nPatient: So what's the next step, doc?\\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and the hiatal hernia diagnosis, your dysphagia is quite severe, so we recommend elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia to alleviate your symptoms.\\nPatient: Alright, if that's what's needed.\\nDoctor: During the surgery, a total of five ports will be placed in your abdomen, and a Nathanson liver retractor will be inserted to retract the left liver lobe. A laparoscopic approach will be used to address the slight adhesion of the greater omentum just under the postoperative scar and the little adhesion with the liver and spleen.\\nPatient: Okay, I understand. When will the surgery be scheduled?\\nDoctor: We'll work on scheduling the surgery as soon as possible and inform you of the date. In the meantime, please follow any preoperative instructions provided by our staff, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\\nPatient: Hi, I've been experiencing constant blurry vision in my left eye for about 6 weeks now.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?\\nPatient: Yeah, I have cystic fibrosis, which has led to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic sinusitis, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.\\nDoctor: Have you had any surgeries in the past?\\nPatient: I had sinus surgery about 7 months ago. It involved bilateral maxillary antrostomies, ethmoidectomies, sphenoidectomies, and frontal sinusotomies.\\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking?\\nPatient: I'm taking albuterol, azithromycin, itraconazole, insulin, lisinopril, pancreatic enzymes, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.\\nDoctor: Do you use tobacco or any drugs?\\nPatient: No, I don't.\\nDoctor: Alright.

Is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, doctor.\\nDoctor: We recently conducted a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) before transferring you to the operating theatre for an ABI insertion. During the MRI, your airway was secured with a size 5.5 mm internal-diameter uncuffed ETT. Did you experience any discomfort during the MRI?\\nPatient: No, it was okay.\\nDoctor: Great. Now, during the surgery, we will be performing intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring, which includes brainstem auditory sensory evoked potentials, brainstem mapping of CN IX, X, XI, XII and their motor nuclei, and corticobulbar tract motor-evoked potential (MEP). This will help us monitor your nerves during the procedure.\\nPatient: Okay, doctor.\\nDoctor: Our anesthesia team will be responsible for the lead placement for CN IX, X, XI, XII. We will use a 32 mm by 29 mm laryngeal electrode for CN X monitoring (Fig.). To ensure optimal electrode placement on the tracheal tube, we positioned you as intended for surgery (right lateral) and identified the depth of ETT corresponding to the laryngeal inlet using a C-MAC Laryngoscope.\\nPatient: Hmm, alright.\\nDoctor: This corresponded to 6 cm at vocal cords (15 cm at lips). We then prepared a new #5.5 uncuffed ETT with the laryngeal electrodes (Fig.) and re-intubated you, in keeping with the measurements. \\nPatient: Okay, got it.\\nDoctor: For CN IX placement, we put a pin electrode on the ipsilateral soft palate. For CN XII, we placed electrodes on the anterior tongue. \\nPatient: I see.\\nDoctor: To stabilize the tracheal tube, we used rolled up gauzes on either side of it (Fig.), which also acted as a bite block.\\nPatient: Alright, doctor.\\nDoctor: During the surgery, we will administer Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) which includes propofol (Paedsfusor Target Control Infusion, target plasma concentration 3.5\\u20135.0 mcg/ml) and remifentanil (0.08\\u20130.3 mcg/kg/min).\\nPatient: Will I feel any pain during the surgery?\\nDoctor: No, the anesthesia will ensure that you remain comfortable and pain-free throughout the procedure.\\nPatient: That's good to know.\\nDoctor: After the surgery, we will closely monitor your recovery and provide any necessary follow-up care. It's important that you follow our instructions to ensure the best possible outcome.\\nPatient: Yes, doctor. I will.\\nDoctor: Great. If you or your family have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, can you tell me what brought you here today?\\nPatient: Hi, I've been having a progressive headache, nausea, and vomiting for about a week. I also noticed some right-side weakness, ptosis, and diplopia.\\nDoctor: I see. Let's talk about when you first presented with these symptoms. Did you experience any conscious disturbance?\\nPatient: Yes, I had an acute onset conscious disturbance, and my Glasgow Coma Scale was E3VaM5 at the hospital.\\nDoctor: Okay, we performed a brain computed tomography and found an enhanced brain tumor with necrotic cystic changes. The tumor is located in your left temporal lobe with upward extension to the left basal ganglion and periventricular region, causing perifocal edema and midline shift.\\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious.\\nDoctor: Yes, it's a serious condition. We performed an emergent craniectomy for tumor removal in December 2006. The pathology revealed pleomorphic, hyperchromatic cells with glassy, astrocytic cytoplasm, as well as hypercellularity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis, consistent with the diagnosis of classic GBM.\\nPatient: What happened after that?\\nDoctor: You underwent radiotherapy a month later, followed by chemotherapy with temozolomide for six months. Your performance status improved to a Karnofsky Grade of 70, and your clinical condition was stable thereafter.\\nPatient: That's good to hear.\\nDoctor: However, a follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in June 2014 revealed a new enhanced nodular lesion, about 1.1 cm in diameter, at your left temporal base. The brain MRI in October 2014 showed a progressive change in lesions, with a maximum of 3.0 cm in diameter.\\nPatient: What did you do about that?\\nDoctor: We performed another surgery for gross tumor removal. Histologically, the tumors showed the oligodendroglial component. Neoplastic cells also showed isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) positivity, diffuse p53 positivity, and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) negativity as revealed by immunostaining.\\nPatient: Hmm, I see.\\nDoctor: During your follow-up, we noticed signs of increased intracranial pressure in May 2015. As a result, you received a third debulking surgery.\\nPatient: What did the third pathology reveal?\\nDoctor: The third pathology revealed both GBM- and PNET-like components. In immunohistochemistry, the PNET-like component exhibited positivity for synaptophysin and CD56 and focal weak positivity for glial fibrillary.\\nPatient: What's the next step for my treatment?\\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide further treatment options as needed. It's important to follow up with us regularly to ensure the best possible care.\\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your help.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your past medical history?\\nPatient: Hi, I don't have any past medical history.\\nDoctor: Okay. What brings you in today?\\nPatient: I've been experiencing painless blurry vision in my right eye for a week now. I've also had intermittent fevers, headache, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on my lower legs for the past 6 months.\\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. Have you had any other symptoms such as neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, Raynaud's phenomenon, oral ulcerations, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity?\\nPatient: No, only an isolated episode of left knee swelling and testicular swelling in the past.\\nDoctor: Do you work with any toxic substances or have any habits like smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use?\\nPatient: No, I work as a flooring installer and I don't have any toxic habits.\\nDoctor: Alright. We checked your vital signs and they were normal. During the physical exam, we found bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema in your right eye, which was greater than in your left eye. You also have a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect and a right afferent pupillary defect. Your muscle strength and reflexes were normal, and your sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception was intact. We also noticed the maculopapular rash on your bilateral lower extremities.\\nPatient: Oh, I see.\\nDoctor: Your admitting labs showed some abnormal results. You have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 11.6 gm/dL, hematocrit of 35.3%, and mean corpuscular volume of 76.9 fL. You also have hyponatremia with a sodium level of 133 mmol/L. Your erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated at 33 mm/hr, and your C-reactive protein (CRP) is also elevated at 13.3 mg/L. Your urinalysis did not show any protein or blood.\\nPatient: Okay. What does that mean?\\nDoctor: These results could indicate an underlying inflammatory or infectious process. We also performed a lumbar puncture, which showed clear and colorless fluid, 2 red blood cells per microliter, and 56 white blood cells per microliter.\\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\\nDoctor: We need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. We'll run additional tests and consult with a specialist to get a clearer understanding of your condition. In the meantime, we'll monitor your symptoms and provide supportive care. We'll keep you informed about any new findings and discuss the best course of treatment.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you, Doctor.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reference_summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"S: The patient is a 7-year-old boy with congenital bilateral sensorineural deafness, reporting a previously failed right cochlear implant.

ESR was elevated at 33 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated at 13.3 mg/L. A: The primary diagnosis is a suspected inflammatory or infectious process, likely caused by a systemic infection. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of symptoms, such as a viral infection or a bacterial infection, but these are less likely given the current findings. P: The management plan includes further imaging and laboratory tests to assess the underlying cause of the symptoms and potential underlying infectious process. The patient will be educated on the importance of reporting any new symptoms or new symptoms. The patient will be provided with support and referrals to a specialist for further evaluation and management.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

Can you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing on your right side?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having this pain in my right upper abdomen, and it's been quite bothersome.\\nDoctor: Hmm, it sounds like you may have a positive Murphy's sign. You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what does that mean for me?\\nDoctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?\\nDoctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. During the procedure, we placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.\\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\\nDoctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?\\nDoctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the ARHD, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.\\nPatient: So, what was done during the surgery?\\nDoctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.\\nPatient: How was the ARHD removed?\\nDoctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. What should I expect during my recovery?\\nDoctor: You will need to follow up with us regularly so we can monitor your progress and ensure proper healing. Make sure to follow any post-operative instructions and contact us if you experience any unusual symptoms or concerns.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dysphagia and significant body weight loss over the past 3 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've had trouble swallowing and I lost around 10 kg in the past 3 months. It's been really tough.\\nDoctor: I see. I've noted that your height is 158.0 cm and your current weight is 53.6 kg. Upon admission, your body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 21.5. Besides this, you also have osteoporosis, which causes you to be bent over. You underwent distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I had the surgery a long time ago.\\nDoctor: According to your operative note, the surgery was performed without lymph node dissection. After the retroperitoneal attachments behind the duodenum were dissected, a Billroth I reconstruction was performed. The resected mass was determined to be an aberrant pancreas. \\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\\nDoctor: We performed an upper gastrointestinal examination and found the presence of your postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed that esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract were absent, which is good news.\\nPatient: Oh, that's a relief.\\nDoctor: However, enhanced computed tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the mediastinum. The stomach was expanded with food remaining inside, and it was compressing the heart in the posterior mediastinum. \\nPatient: That sounds serious.\\nDoctor: It is a concern, but fortunately, you have no symptoms of cardiac failure, and your heart function was normal on echocardiography. Preoperative eCT also showed that the right and left gastric arteries and the gastroepiploic arteries were preserved, which indicates that the distal gastrectomy was performed without lymph node dissection. \\nPatient: So what's the next step, doc?\\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and the hiatal hernia diagnosis, your dysphagia is quite severe, so we recommend elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia to alleviate your symptoms.\\nPatient: Alright, if that's what's needed.\\nDoctor: During the surgery, a total of five ports will be placed in your abdomen, and a Nathanson liver retractor will be inserted to retract the left liver lobe. A laparoscopic approach will be used to address the slight adhesion of the greater omentum just under the postoperative scar and the little adhesion with the liver and spleen.\\nPatient: Okay, I understand. When will the surgery be scheduled?\\nDoctor: We'll work on scheduling the surgery as soon as possible and inform you of the date. In the meantime, please follow any preoperative instructions provided by our staff, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\\nPatient: Hi, I've been experiencing constant blurry vision in my left eye for about 6 weeks now.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?\\nPatient: Yeah, I have cystic fibrosis, which has led to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic sinusitis, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.\\nDoctor: Have you had any surgeries in the past?\\nPatient: I had sinus surgery about 7 months ago. It involved bilateral maxillary antrostomies, ethmoidectomies, sphenoidectomies, and frontal sinusotomies.\\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking?\\nPatient: I'm taking albuterol, azithromycin, itraconazole, insulin, lisinopril, pancreatic enzymes, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.\\nDoctor: Do you use tobacco or any drugs?\\nPatient: No, I don't.\\nDoctor: Alright. At the time of presentation, your visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, intraocular pressure was 18 OD and 16 OS, and your pupils were 4 mm and reactive in both eyes. Your anterior exam was unremarkable, but your posterior exam in the left eye showed intraretinal hemorrhages along the nerve fiber layer with associated retinal thickening in the inferior macula, consistent with a BRVO.\\nPatient: Oh, I see.\\nDoctor: We also performed optical coherence tomography which revealed mild intraretinal and trace subfoveal fluid in your left eye. These findings were confirmed with a fluorescein angiogram, which showed delayed venous filling in the inferior venous arcade.\\nPatient: Okay, so what does that mean?\\nDoctor: It means there might be an issue with the blood vessels in your eye. Your blood pressure readings have been consistently between 110 and 145 systolic over 70-85 diastolic in the past year, and your most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.9% 4 months prior to presentation. We also did a laboratory workup.\\nPatient: What did the lab results show?\\nDoctor: The complete blood cell count, Vitamin A and D levels, prothrombin time, thrombin time, antithrombin activity, Protein C and S activity, cardiolipins, dilute Russell's viper venom time, homocysteine level, and a negative prothrombin G20210A mutation were all normal. Your complete metabolic panel showed a mild elevation in glucose of 121 mg/dL, and your antinuclear antibody was weakly elevated at 2.\\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\\nDoctor: The results indicate that there might be an issue with your blood vessels related to your blurry vision. We will need to monitor your blood pressure and glucose levels closely and consider further testing or treatment options based on your progress.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you for the information.\\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Upper gastrointestinal examination showed postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity and absence of esophagitis and tumors in the upper digestive tract. Enhanced computed tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia with the entire stomach sliding into the mediastinum, compressing the heart, but no symptoms of cardiac failure were observed. Heart function is normal as per echocardiography.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is a large hiatal hernia causing severe dysphagia and weight loss. The patient's previous surgical history and current imaging support the diagnosis. Differential diagnoses such as esophagitis and tumors in the upper digestive tract have been ruled out.\\nP: Plan to perform elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia using a laparoscopic approach with five abdominal ports and a Nathanson liver retractor.

Can you please tell me what concerns you have about your skin?\\nPatient: Yeah, I have this brown papule on my upper back, and it's within a large tattoo. I'm not really sure how long it's been there or if it was there when I got the tattoo.\\nDoctor: I see. Let me take a closer look. Hmm, it appears to be an 8-millimeter flat, brown papule. Since we're uncertain about the lesion's initial presentation, pattern of growth, and appearance, I would recommend a shave removal of the lesion to examine it further. How does that sound?\\nPatient: Okay, I guess that sounds fine.\\n[After the shave removal and excision]\\nDoctor: We have examined the original excision, and it showed an atypical intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation. The dermis also contained scattered foci of tattoo pigment and fibrosis. It's important to note that an early evolving melanoma in situ couldn't be excluded at that time.\\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\\nDoctor: Don't worry, we took further action by re-excising the lesion with a 5-millimeter margin. Upon examination, no residual melanocytic lesion was detected, only scar tissue was present. This is a positive sign.\\nPatient: That's a relief. So what's next?\\nDoctor: You have healed well since the excision, and we will continue to monitor your skin to ensure there are no further concerns. It's important to keep an eye on any changes in your skin and report them to us.\\nPatient: Alright, I'll make sure to pay attention to my skin and let you know if I notice anything unusual.\\nDoctor: That's great. Remember, early detection and intervention are key to managing any potential issues. If you have any concerns or questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.\\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care and have a great day!\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 68-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, newly-diagnosed liver cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I. You were admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology service for a planned transvaginal hysterectomy. Can you tell me more about your medical history and any current symptoms you're experiencing?\\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I don't have any history of significant alcohol use, and my viral hepatitis serologies were negative for hepatitis A, B, and C.\\nDoctor: I noticed that your ferritin level was 319 ng/ml, which makes hemochromatosis unlikely. Your anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies were also negative. So, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are unlikely in the absence of other clinical findings. We also considered Wilson's disease, but your serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal, and you did not have any psychiatric symptoms.\\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. I also remember that my \\u03b1-1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mg/dl.\\nDoctor: Based on your medical history, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) seems to be the most probable explanation for your cirrhosis, given that you have type 2 diabetes mellitus, a body mass index (BMI) of 29.83, and hyperlipidemia. However, you've been taking methotrexate for more than 10 years for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, which could also be a contributing factor.\\nPatient: Hmm, I see. So what happened during my preoperative evaluation?\\nDoctor: During the evaluation, your resting supine oxygen saturation was noted to be 93%. At that time, you denied any respiratory or cardiac symptoms, so you underwent the transvaginal hysterectomy, which went smoothly with no complications.\\nPatient: That's good to hear. But I remember feeling short of breath after the surgery.\\nDoctor: Yes, on postoperative day two, you became dyspneic while walking to the restroom. We also noted a two-gram drop in your hemoglobin level after surgery, which was promptly corrected with two units of packed red blood cells.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. Did that help with my shortness of breath?\\nDoctor: Unfortunately, despite the administration of packed red blood cell transfusions, you still experienced hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82% while sitting up and during ambulation. When you tried to ambulate further, you developed perioral cyanosis.\\nPatient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. What should I do now, Doctor?\\nDoctor: We will continue to closely monitor your condition and provide necessary medical support. It's important that you report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. We will work together to ensure your recovery and to manage your various health conditions.\\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, I see you've come in for an outpatient consultation regarding painful right upper thoracic radiculopathy. Can you tell me how long you've been experiencing this pain?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've been dealing with this pain for about 18 months now. It's been pretty bad.\\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain, how would you rate your pain?\\nPatient: I'd say it's around a 7 or 8 out of 10.\\nDoctor: Have you found anything that helps relieve the pain?\\nPatient: Yes, I've been taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and they seem to help.\\nDoctor: Good to know. Do you have any muscle contracture or pain when I press on the area?\\nPatient: No, I don't have any contracture, and it doesn't hurt when you press on it.\\nDoctor: Can you show me exactly where the pain is located?\\nPatient: It's about 3 cm from the thoracic midline on the right side, and I feel some intercostal irradiation too.\\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. Based on the radiographs we took, we didn't find any osteolysis or deformity. However, the MRI showed a T2 hypersignal and a T1 hyposignal at the medial side of your right T1 vertebra, along with inflammation of the right T1 root. The radioisotope bone scanning also revealed lateral hyperfixation on the right side of your T1 vertebra.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\\nDoctor: The CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of your right T1 pedicle. The lesion is close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve, which is causing the inflammation and pain you're experiencing. The aspect of the lesion is compatible with a condition called osteoid osteoma.\\nPatient: What can be done about it?\\nDoctor: Our team recommends a surgical resection using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance. Because the lesion is so close to the dura mater, we cannot perform radiofrequency ablation, which would require thermal ablation. The surgery should be safe and complete, with no risk of recurrence. We'll also make sure to preserve the vertebral stability without needing screw fixation.\\nPatient: What should I expect during the surgery?\\nDoctor: You'll be in a prone position under general anesthesia. We'll use a new all-in-one imaging device called Surgivisio\\u00ae to control the vertebral level in two-dimensional (2D) mode. This machine is a 2D/3D C-arm designed to be combined with surgical navigation. We'll perform a mini-open posterior approach at the C7-T2 levels.\\nPatient: Thank you for explaining all of this to me. I feel more comfortable knowing what to expect.\\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to make the procedure as smooth and successful as possible.

Initial excision biopsy indicated atypical intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation with scattered foci of tattoo pigment and fibrosis in the dermis. A subsequent re-excision with a 5-mm margin showed no residual melanocytic lesion, only scar tissue.\\nA: The primary diagnosis was a suspicious melanocytic lesion, with a differential diagnosis of early evolving melanoma in situ, which could not be excluded initially. The absence of a melanocytic lesion in the re-excised sample suggests successful removal of the atypical cells.\\nP: The patient will undergo regular skin monitoring to detect any new changes or recurrence.

Despite this, she developed hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82% while sitting up and during ambulation, and perioral cyanosis on further ambulation.\\nA: Primary diagnosis is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, potentially exacerbated by long-term methotrexate use. Postoperative complications include significant hypoxemia and potential anemia. Differential diagnoses for her respiratory symptoms could include pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or pneumonia.\\nP: Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and hemoglobin levels. Consider further diagnostic workup for postoperative respiratory distress, including chest X-ray and possibly a CT pulmonary angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism. Ensure adequate oxygenation and consider respiratory support if hypoxemia persists. Educate the patient on the importance of reporting new or worsening symptoms.

?\\n[patient] hi . good to see you .\\n[doctor] it's good to see you as well . are you ready to get started ?\\n[patient] yes , i am .\\n[doctor] louis is a 58-year-old male here for follow up from an emergency room visit . so , louis , what happened ?\\n[patient] yeah . i was playing tennis on saturday . it was really , really hot that day , very humid . and about after about a half an hour i was very short of breath , i was struggling breathing . i thought i was having a heart attack , got really nervous . so , my wife took me to the er and , uh , everything checked out , but i was just very upset about it .\\n[doctor] okay . all right . and how have you been feeling since that time ?\\n[patient] uh , foof , probably , probably about six hours after we got home , i felt very light-head and very dizzy and then , sunday , i felt fine . i just thought it was worth checking up with you though .\\n[doctor] okay . and have you been taking all of your meds for your heart failure ?\\n[patient] i have . i have . i've been , uh , very diligent with it . and , uh , i'm in touch with the doctor and so far , so good , other than this episode on saturday .\\n[doctor] okay . and , and you're watching your diet , you're avoiding salt . have you had anything salty ?\\n[patient] i cheat every now and then . you know , i try and stay away from the junk food and the salty foods . but , for the most part , i've been doing a good job of that .\\n[doctor] okay . all right . um , and i know that they removed a cataract from your eye-\\n[patient] mm-hmm .\\n[doctor] . a couple of , like couple months ago . that's been fine ?\\n[patient] that was three months ago , thursday , and everything's been fine ever since .\\n[doctor] okay . so , no vision problems .\\n[patient] no .\\n[doctor] okay . and you had a skin cancer removed about five months ago as well . you've had a lot going on .\\n[patient] yeah . it's been a really busy year . an- and again , so far , so good . that healed up nicely , no problems ever since .\\n[doctor] okay . all right . um , so , why do n't we go ahead and we'll do a quick physical-\\n[patient] mm-hmm .\\n[doctor] . exam . hey , dragon , show me the blood pressure . so , here , your blood pressure is a little high .\\n[patient] mm-hmm .\\n[doctor] um , so , you know , i did see a report in the emergency room that your blood pressure was high there as well .\\n[patient] mm-hmm .\\n[doctor] so , we'll have to just kind of talk about that . uh , but let's go ahead and we'll examine you .\\n[patient] sure .\\n[doctor] okay ?\\n[patient] mm-hmm .\\n[doctor] okay . so , you know , looking at you , your neck is very supple . i do n't appreciate any fibular venous distention . your heart is a regular rate and rhythm , no murmur . your lungs have some fine crackles in them , bilaterally . and you have trace lower extremity edema in both legs . so , what that means , essentially , is that you may have some extra fluid on board , um , from eating salty foods-\\n[patient] mm-hmm .\\n[doctor] . along with this history of your congestive heart failure . but , let's go ahead and look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the ecg . so , this is , uh , a s- a stable ecg for you . this basically shows that you have some left ventricular hypertrophy which caused your congestive heart failure . um , let's go ahead and review your echocardiogram . hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . so , in reviewing the results of your echocardiogram , it shows that your pumping function of your heart is a little low , uh , but it's stable . and , you know , i think that we know this and we have you on the appropriate-\\n[patient] mm-hmm .\\n[doctor] medication therapy . and then , i just wan na be reminded about , um , the results of your skin biopsy . hey , dragon , show me the skin biopsy results . okay . and in reviewing the pathology report for your skin cancer-\\n[patient] mm-hmm .\\n[doctor] . you know , it looks like they got all of that and everything's fine .\\n[patient] yep .\\n[doctor] so , you know , my impression of you at this time , for the shortness of breath that you had in the emergency department , i think it was an exacerbation of your heart failure . and you probably had some , what we call , dietary indiscretion , you ate some salty food which made you retain some fluid .\\n[patient] mm-hmm .\\n[doctor] so , for that , i'm going to prescribe you , you know , an extra dose of lasix 80 milligrams , once a day . and , um , we're going to , uh , put you on some carvedilol 25 milligrams , twice a day . okay ?\\n[patient] okay . perfect .\\n[doctor] um , and i think from a , a cataract surgery standpoint and your skin cancer removal , everything seems to be fine and you're doing well , so i do n't think we need to adjust any of those medications .\\n[patient] good to hear .\\n[doctor] okay ? hey , dragon , order lasix 80 milligrams , once a day . hey , dragon , order carvedilol 25 milligrams , twice a day . okay . and the nurse will come in and she'll see you soon . okay ?\\n[patient] great .\\n[doctor] hey , dragon , finalize the note .\",\n          \"[doctor] carolyn is a 34 -year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type two who is here today with a headache so hi there carolyn it's nice to see you again listen i'm sorry you're having headaches well let's talk about it but i would like to record this conversation with this app that's gon na help me focus on you more would that be okay with you\\n[patient] yes that's okay\\n[doctor] okay great thanks so carolyn tell me about your headache and headache or headaches when did when did they start and and what symptoms are you having\\n[patient] my headache started about a week ago it's feeling like a dull pain in the back of my head i have flushing in my ears they get really red and hot and sometimes i just feel a little bit dizzy when i get these headaches but i've taken tylenol and advil and it's not really going away it just keeps coming back\\n[doctor] okay and alright and so this started about a week ago has it been fairly constant since it started or does it come and go does it come and go or what\\n[patient] it comes and goes i it it's relieved when i take my tylenol or advil but then it comes right back\\n[doctor] hmmm okay and do you notice any any timing difference you know is it is it worse in the morning worse in the evening is there anything else that makes it better or worse\\n[patient] it's definitely worse in the evening\\n[doctor] okay and do you feel any sort of tightness in the back of your neck or in your shoulders or you know you said it's in the back of your head primarily any discomfort anywhere else\\n[patient] yes no just in the back of my head\\n[doctor] okay and did the headache start all of a sudden carolyn or has it been gradual or what\\n[patient] i've been under a lot of stress lately so maybe about when some stress started occurring\\n[doctor] okay okay and alright and have you noticed any fever along with the headache\\n[patient] no no fever\\n[doctor] okay and any visual changes you know wavy lines in your vision spots in your vision or anything like that\\n[patient] no\\n[doctor] okay and have you had headaches like this before\\n[patient] i have\\n[doctor] okay so this is n't the worst headache you've ever had what did you say\\n[patient] no it's not\\n[doctor] okay alright and so okay fair enough now how's your diabetes been been been doing lately have you what have your blood sugars been running in the low one hundreds or two hundreds or what\\n[patient] i have n't been checking my blood sugars\\n[doctor] really okay well we will get you back on that and and we can talk about that but how about your metformin are you still taking the five hundred milligrams once a day no actually it looks like we increased your metformin to five hundred milligrams twice a day last visit are you still taking that\\n[patient] yes\\n[doctor] okay great and okay you're still watching your diet and getting some exercise\\n[patient] i have not been eating well because i've been stressed over the last week but i have n't been exercising for maybe the past week but generally i've been doing better\\n[doctor] okay the headache has has maybe made you feel uncomfortable and prevented your your exercise would you say or what\\n[patient] yes it has\\n[doctor] okay okay so you probably have n't been out golfing i remember you're a big golfer so not not lately uh so you know being\\n[patient] not lately\\n[doctor] being down being down here in florida we got ta get get some golf in so hey did you see the masters by the way a few weeks ago was n't that i do n't know did you happen to catch it\\n[patient] i did\\n[doctor] yeah that was crazy what a what a finish what an amazing what an amazing tournament right what do you think yeah yeah that's great well we'll we'll get you feeling better and get you back out there and now are you still working a lot on the computer ac or\\n[patient] i am\\n[doctor] carolyn okay yeah you're still working a lot on the computer for work okay are you taking breaks every hour or so you know get up stand around walk stand walk around that can be helpful\\n[patient] no i really do n't get the opportunity to\\n[doctor] hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me\\n[patient] well would it so only call if if it gets worse or not any better\\n[doctor] yeah that that just right but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks and i wan na see you back in four weeks if it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexeril then you can give us a call and and get back in later this week or early next but definitely if things get worse give us a call sooner and you know i meant to ask you on i wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you hit your head or you have n't fallen hit your head or anything like that have you\\n[patient] no no i think it's just stress\\n[doctor] okay alright understood okay great well then i'll see you back in a month if not before okay you take care of yourself nice seeing you\\n[patient] thank you\\n[doctor] sure\",\n          \"[doctor] sophia brown . date of birth , 3/17/1946 . this is a new patient visit . she's here to establish care for a history of dcis . we'll go over the history with the patient .\\n[doctor] hello , ms. brown .\\n[patient] hi . yes , that's me .\\n[doctor] wonderful . i'm doctor stewart . it's lovely to meet you .\\n[patient] you as well .\\n[doctor] so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?\\n[patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .\\n[doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?\\n[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .\\n[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?\\n[patient] sounds good .\\n[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?\\n[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .\\n[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .\\n[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .\\n[doctor] yep , definitely .\\n[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .\\n[patient] yes . unfortunately .\\n[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !\\n[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .\\n[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .\\n[patient] yes .\\n[doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?\\n[patient] yes . fingers crossed .\\n[doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .\\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\\n[doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?\\n[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .\\n[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?\\n[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .\\n[doctor] okay . do you have children ?\\n[patient] i do . i have five .\\n[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .\\n[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .\\n[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .\\n[patient] it is .\\n[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?\\n[patient] really , i did not .\\n[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?\\n[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .\\n[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .\\n[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .\\n[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?\\n[patient] that's correct .\\n[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?\\n[patient] yes , and that's all .\\n[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?\\n[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .\\n[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?\\n[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .\\n[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?\\n[patient] none .\\n[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?\\n[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .\\n[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?\\n[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .\\n[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?\\n[patient] nope , just penicillin .\\n[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .\\n[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .\\n[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .\\n[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?\\n[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .\\n[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .\\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\\n[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .\\n[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .\\n[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?\\n[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .\\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\\n[doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?\\n[patient] i do n't think so .\\n[doctor] okay , great . my nurse will be in shortly to discharge you . take care !\\n[patient] you as well .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
