Can you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing on your right side?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having this pain in my right upper abdomen, and it's been quite bothersome.\\nDoctor: Hmm, it sounds like you may have a positive Murphy's sign. You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what does that mean for me?\\nDoctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?\\nDoctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. During the procedure, we placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.\\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\\nDoctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?\\nDoctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the ARHD, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.\\nPatient: So, what was done during the surgery?\\nDoctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.\\nPatient: How was the ARHD removed?\\nDoctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. What should I expect during my recovery?\\nDoctor: You will need to follow up with us regularly so we can monitor your progress and ensure proper healing. Make sure to follow any post-operative instructions and contact us if you experience any unusual symptoms or concerns.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dysphagia and significant body weight loss over the past 3 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've had trouble swallowing and I lost around 10 kg in the past 3 months. It's been really tough.\\nDoctor: I see. I've noted that your height is 158.0 cm and your current weight is 53.6 kg. Upon admission, your body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 21.5. Besides this, you also have osteoporosis, which causes you to be bent over. You underwent distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I had the surgery a long time ago.\\nDoctor: According to your operative note, the surgery was performed without lymph node dissection. After the retroperitoneal attachments behind the duodenum were dissected, a Billroth I reconstruction was performed. The resected mass was determined to be an aberrant pancreas. \\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\\nDoctor: We performed an upper gastrointestinal examination and found the presence of your postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed that esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract were absent, which is good news.\\nPatient: Oh, that's a relief.\\nDoctor: However, enhanced computed tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the mediastinum. The stomach was expanded with food remaining inside, and it was compressing the heart in the posterior mediastinum. \\nPatient: That sounds serious.\\nDoctor: It is a concern, but fortunately, you have no symptoms of cardiac failure, and your heart function was normal on echocardiography. Preoperative eCT also showed that the right and left gastric arteries and the gastroepiploic arteries were preserved, which indicates that the distal gastrectomy was performed without lymph node dissection. \\nPatient: So what's the next step, doc?\\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and the hiatal hernia diagnosis, your dysphagia is quite severe, so we recommend elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia to alleviate your symptoms.\\nPatient: Alright, if that's what's needed.\\nDoctor: During the surgery, a total of five ports will be placed in your abdomen, and a Nathanson liver retractor will be inserted to retract the left liver lobe. A laparoscopic approach will be used to address the slight adhesion of the greater omentum just under the postoperative scar and the little adhesion with the liver and spleen.\\nPatient: Okay, I understand. When will the surgery be scheduled?\\nDoctor: We'll work on scheduling the surgery as soon as possible and inform you of the date. In the meantime, please follow any preoperative instructions provided by our staff, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\\nPatient: Hi, I've been experiencing constant blurry vision in my left eye for about 6 weeks now.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?\\nPatient: Yeah, I have cystic fibrosis, which has led to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic sinusitis, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.\\nDoctor: Have you had any surgeries in the past?\\nPatient: I had sinus surgery about 7 months ago. It involved bilateral maxillary antrostomies, ethmoidectomies, sphenoidectomies, and frontal sinusotomies.\\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking?\\nPatient: I'm taking albuterol, azithromycin, itraconazole, insulin, lisinopril, pancreatic enzymes, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.\\nDoctor: Do you use tobacco or any drugs?\\nPatient: No, I don't.\\nDoctor: Alright. At the time of presentation, your visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, intraocular pressure was 18 OD and 16 OS, and your pupils were 4 mm and reactive in both eyes. Your anterior exam was unremarkable, but your posterior exam in the left eye showed intraretinal hemorrhages along the nerve fiber layer with associated retinal thickening in the inferior macula, consistent with a BRVO.\\nPatient: Oh, I see.\\nDoctor: We also performed optical coherence tomography which revealed mild intraretinal and trace subfoveal fluid in your left eye. These findings were confirmed with a fluorescein angiogram, which showed delayed venous filling in the inferior venous arcade.\\nPatient: Okay, so what does that mean?\\nDoctor: It means there might be an issue with the blood vessels in your eye. Your blood pressure readings have been consistently between 110 and 145 systolic over 70-85 diastolic in the past year, and your most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.9% 4 months prior to presentation. We also did a laboratory workup.\\nPatient: What did the lab results show?\\nDoctor: The complete blood cell count, Vitamin A and D levels, prothrombin time, thrombin time, antithrombin activity, Protein C and S activity, cardiolipins, dilute Russell's viper venom time, homocysteine level, and a negative prothrombin G20210A mutation were all normal. Your complete metabolic panel showed a mild elevation in glucose of 121 mg/dL, and your antinuclear antibody was weakly elevated at 2.\\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\\nDoctor: The results indicate that there might be an issue with your blood vessels related to your blurry vision. We will need to monitor your blood pressure and glucose levels closely and consider further testing or treatment options based on your progress.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you for the information.\\nDoctor: You're welcome.

The prognosis depends on the management of underlying conditions and response to treatment.\\nP: Plan to monitor blood pressure and glucose levels closely. Initiate or adjust antihypertensive and diabetic medications as needed. Refer to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and possible intravitreal injections or laser therapy for BRVO. Educate patient on the importance of controlling blood pressure and blood sugar levels to prevent progression of ocular and systemic complications. Schedule follow-up in 1 month to reassess condition and treatment efficacy. Encourage patient to report any worsening of symptoms immediately.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"fine_tuned_model_output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"S: The patient reports persistent pain in the right upper abdomen, which is bothersome. The patient has a history of cholelithiasis and a positive Murphy's sign. O: Physical examination revealed a gallstone in the thickened gallbladder wall. Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media showed a slight increase in CT value due to surrounding panniculitis. Medical Review Council of the Philippines (MRCP) confirmed chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed to address the issue. The rightmost rightmost duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed due to inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle. Intraoperative cholangiography showed the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct. A: The primary diagnosis is chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of gallbladder disease, but these are less likely given the surgical intervention and the patient's history of cholelithiasis. P: The patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. The procedure was performed with four ports placed in the umbilical area, the epigastric area, the right subcostal area, and the right lateral abdomen. The ARHD was removed and drained. The patient was advised to report any new symptoms or concerns immediately.\",\n          \"S: The patient, a male with a height of 158.0 cm, a BMI of 21.5, and a weight of 53.6 kg, presents with symptoms of difficulty swallowing and significant body weight loss over the past 3 months. He has a history of distal gastrectomy 40 years ago, which was performed without lymph node dissection. He has a history of osteoporosis and a history of hiatal hernia, which was diagnosed with enhanced computed tomography (eCT). O: Initial examination revealed postoperative stomach in the abdomen via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract absent. Preoperative eCT revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the thoracicum. A: The primary diagnosis is a hiatal hernia, complicated by the presence of a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the thoracicum. The patient's symptoms and hiatal hernia diagnosis are severe, requiring surgical intervention. The patient has a history of distal gastrectomy and osteoporosis, which are likely contributing to the weight loss. P: The management plan includes elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia to alleviate symptoms and improve recovery. The patient will be monitored closely for any complications or complications. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor recovery and manage any new symptoms.\",\n          \"S: The patient, a cystic fibrosis patient with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic sinusitis, hypertension, iron deficiency, and obstructive sleep disorders, reports constant blurry vision in the left eye for about 6 weeks. The patient denies tobacco or any drugs. O: Physical examination revealed 20/20 visual acuity in both eyes, intraocular pressure at 18 OD, and 16 OS, and pupil diameters at 4 mm. posterior exam showed intraretinal hemorrhages along the nerve fiber layer with associated retinal thickening in the inferior macula, consistent with a Brugada retinopathy of the eye (BRVO). Optical coherence tomography revealed mild intraretinal and trace subfoveal fluid in the left eye. Fluorescein angiogram confirmed delayed venous filling in the inferior venous arcade. Laboratory findings included complete blood cell count, Vitamin A and D levels, prothrombin time, thrombin time, antithrombin activity, Protein C and S, dilute Russell's viper venom time, level, and a negative prothrombin G20210A mutation. A: The primary diagnosis is Brugada retinopathy of the eye (BRVO), complicated by the presence of intraretinal hemorrhages and delayed venous filling in the inferior venous arcade. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of retinal hemorrhages and retinal thickening, but these are less likely given the current clinical presentation and laboratory findings. P: The management plan includes close monitoring of the patient's condition and the potential for further complications. The patient will be educated on the importance of reporting any new symptoms or concerns immediately. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":49}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_soap_gens_2 = []\n","\n","for i in range(50, 100):\n","    print(f\"Sample {i}:\")\n","    dialogue = ds[\"test\"][i][\"augmented_dialogue\"]\n","    note = ds[\"test\"][i][\"soap_note\"]\n","\n","    output = get_response(dialogue, note, ft_model)\n","\n","    test_soap_gens_2.append({\n","        'dialogue': dialogue,\n","        'reference_note': note,\n","        'fine_tuned_model_output': output\n","    })\n","\n","test_soap_gens_df_2 = pd.DataFrame(test_soap_gens_2)\n","test_soap_gens_df_2.to_csv(f\"{checkpoints_dir}/test_soap_50_100.csv\", index=False)\n","print(f\"Saved to: {checkpoints_dir}/test_soap_50_100.csv\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"C1zF-LdkDvue","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749630300948,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":422508,"user":{"displayName":"Unforgiven The","userId":"10817091228202119239"}},"outputId":"6897aa5d-0066-4f9e-e010-c2c8e91d6fe5","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['length_penalty'].

Can you please tell me what concerns you have about your skin?\\nPatient: Yeah, I have this brown papule on my upper back, and it's within a large tattoo. I'm not really sure how long it's been there or if it was there when I got the tattoo.\\nDoctor: I see. Let me take a closer look. Hmm, it appears to be an 8-millimeter flat, brown papule. Since we're uncertain about the lesion's initial presentation, pattern of growth, and appearance, I would recommend a shave removal of the lesion to examine it further. How does that sound?\\nPatient: Okay, I guess that sounds fine.\\n[After the shave removal and excision]\\nDoctor: We have examined the original excision, and it showed an atypical intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation. The dermis also contained scattered foci of tattoo pigment and fibrosis. It's important to note that an early evolving melanoma in situ couldn't be excluded at that time.\\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\\nDoctor: Don't worry, we took further action by re-excising the lesion with a 5-millimeter margin. Upon examination, no residual melanocytic lesion was detected, only scar tissue was present. This is a positive sign.\\nPatient: That's a relief. So what's next?\\nDoctor: You have healed well since the excision, and we will continue to monitor your skin to ensure there are no further concerns. It's important to keep an eye on any changes in your skin and report them to us.\\nPatient: Alright, I'll make sure to pay attention to my skin and let you know if I notice anything unusual.\\nDoctor: That's great. Remember, early detection and intervention are key to managing any potential issues. If you have any concerns or questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.\\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care and have a great day!\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 68-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, newly-diagnosed liver cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I. You were admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology service for a planned transvaginal hysterectomy. Can you tell me more about your medical history and any current symptoms you're experiencing?\\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I don't have any history of significant alcohol use, and my viral hepatitis serologies were negative for hepatitis A, B, and C.\\nDoctor: I noticed that your ferritin level was 319 ng/ml, which makes hemochromatosis unlikely. Your anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies were also negative. So, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are unlikely in the absence of other clinical findings. We also considered Wilson's disease, but your serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal, and you did not have any psychiatric symptoms.\\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. I also remember that my \\u03b1-1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mg/dl.\\nDoctor: Based on your medical history, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) seems to be the most probable explanation for your cirrhosis, given that you have type 2 diabetes mellitus, a body mass index (BMI) of 29.83, and hyperlipidemia. However, you've been taking methotrexate for more than 10 years for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, which could also be a contributing factor.\\nPatient: Hmm, I see. So what happened during my preoperative evaluation?\\nDoctor: During the evaluation, your resting supine oxygen saturation was noted to be 93%. At that time, you denied any respiratory or cardiac symptoms, so you underwent the transvaginal hysterectomy, which went smoothly with no complications.\\nPatient: That's good to hear. But I remember feeling short of breath after the surgery.\\nDoctor: Yes, on postoperative day two, you became dyspneic while walking to the restroom. We also noted a two-gram drop in your hemoglobin level after surgery, which was promptly corrected with two units of packed red blood cells.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. Did that help with my shortness of breath?\\nDoctor: Unfortunately, despite the administration of packed red blood cell transfusions, you still experienced hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82% while sitting up and during ambulation. When you tried to ambulate further, you developed perioral cyanosis.\\nPatient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. What should I do now, Doctor?\\nDoctor: We will continue to closely monitor your condition and provide necessary medical support. It's important that you report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. We will work together to ensure your recovery and to manage your various health conditions.\\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, I see you've come in for an outpatient consultation regarding painful right upper thoracic radiculopathy. Can you tell me how long you've been experiencing this pain?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've been dealing with this pain for about 18 months now. It's been pretty bad.\\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain, how would you rate your pain?\\nPatient: I'd say it's around a 7 or 8 out of 10.\\nDoctor: Have you found anything that helps relieve the pain?\\nPatient: Yes, I've been taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and they seem to help.\\nDoctor: Good to know. Do you have any muscle contracture or pain when I press on the area?\\nPatient: No, I don't have any contracture, and it doesn't hurt when you press on it.\\nDoctor: Can you show me exactly where the pain is located?\\nPatient: It's about 3 cm from the thoracic midline on the right side, and I feel some intercostal irradiation too.\\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. Based on the radiographs we took, we didn't find any osteolysis or deformity. However, the MRI showed a T2 hypersignal and a T1 hyposignal at the medial side of your right T1 vertebra, along with inflammation of the right T1 root. The radioisotope bone scanning also revealed lateral hyperfixation on the right side of your T1 vertebra.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\\nDoctor: The CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of your right T1 pedicle. The lesion is close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve, which is causing the inflammation and pain you're experiencing. The aspect of the lesion is compatible with a condition called osteoid osteoma.\\nPatient: What can be done about it?\\nDoctor: Our team recommends a surgical resection using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance. Because the lesion is so close to the dura mater, we cannot perform radiofrequency ablation, which would require thermal ablation. The surgery should be safe and complete, with no risk of recurrence. We'll also make sure to preserve the vertebral stability without needing screw fixation.\\nPatient: What should I expect during the surgery?\\nDoctor: You'll be in a prone position under general anesthesia. We'll use a new all-in-one imaging device called Surgivisio\\u00ae to control the vertebral level in two-dimensional (2D) mode. This machine is a 2D/3D C-arm designed to be combined with surgical navigation. We'll perform a mini-open posterior approach at the C7-T2 levels.\\nPatient: Thank you for explaining all of this to me. I feel more comfortable knowing what to expect.\\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to make the procedure as smooth and successful as possible.

Initial excision biopsy indicated atypical intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation with scattered foci of tattoo pigment and fibrosis in the dermis. A subsequent re-excision with a 5-mm margin showed no residual melanocytic lesion, only scar tissue.\\nA: The primary diagnosis was a suspicious melanocytic lesion, with a differential diagnosis of early evolving melanoma in situ, which could not be excluded initially. The absence of a melanocytic lesion in the re-excised sample suggests successful removal of the atypical cells.\\nP: The patient will undergo regular skin monitoring to detect any new changes or recurrence.

Her BMI is 29.83. Preoperative resting supine oxygen saturation was 93%. Postoperatively, she experienced a drop in hemoglobin by two grams, corrected with two units of packed red blood cells. Despite this, she developed hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82% while sitting up and during ambulation, and perioral cyanosis on further ambulation.\\nA: Primary diagnosis is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, potentially exacerbated by long-term methotrexate use. Postoperative complications include significant hypoxemia and potential anemia. Differential diagnoses for her respiratory symptoms could include pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or pneumonia.\\nP: Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and hemoglobin levels. Consider further diagnostic workup for postoperative respiratory distress, including chest X-ray and possibly a CT pulmonary angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism. Ensure adequate oxygenation and consider respiratory support if hypoxemia persists. Educate the patient on the importance of reporting new or worsening symptoms.

Differential diagnoses were considered but ruled out based on imaging studies.\\nP: The management plan includes surgical resection of the osteoid osteoma using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance, specifically using the Surgivisio\\u00ae system for intraoperative navigation. Radiofrequency ablation is contraindicated due to the proximity of the lesion to critical structures. The patient will be positioned prone under general anesthesia, and a mini-open posterior approach at the C7-T2 levels will be performed.

O: The patient's ferritin level was 319 ng/ml, with negative anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies. Serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal. -1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mg/dl. Postoperatively, the patient experienced hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82%. A: The primary diagnosis is liver cirrhosis, likely caused by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), with secondary causes including rheumatoid arthritis and hyperlipidemia. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of liver disease, but these are less likely given the patient's history and current symptoms. P: The management plan includes monitoring the patient's blood sugar levels and electrolytes closely. The patient will be advised to continue methotrexate therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and hyperlipidemia. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess the patient's recovery and manage any complications. The patient will be educated on the importance of reporting any new symptoms or concerns immediately.\",\n          \"S: The patient reports experiencing painful right upper thoracic radiculopathy for 18 months. The patient has been taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which alleviate the pain. No muscle contracture or pain is reported. O: Physical examination revealed a 3 cm area from the thoracic midline on the right side of the patient's right T1 vertebra, with intercostal irradiation. MRI and radioisotope bone scanning confirmed T2 hypersignal and T1 hyposignal at the medial side of the right T1 vertebra, inflammation of the right T1 root, and lateral hyperfixation on the right side of the T1 vertebra. CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of the right T1 pedicle. The lesion is close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve, which is causing inflammation and pain. A: The primary diagnosis is osteoid osteoma, a complex condition involving osteoid bone, dura mater, and T1 spinal nerve. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of radiculopathy, but these are less likely given the location and extent of the lesion. P: The management plan includes surgical resection of the osteolytic lesion, which is recommended using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance. The patient will be in a prone position under general anesthesia. The patient will be monitored closely for any complications or complications. The patient will be advised to report any new symptoms or concerns immediately.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":57}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Check loss"],"metadata":{"id":"Pc8VflhJawP_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["checkpoints_path"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":53},"id":"76jETADAVrOu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749629130521,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Unforgiven The","userId":"10817091228202119239"}},"outputId":"303a3044-70e2-4c52-b28c-e11b88c7fa3b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'/content/drive/MyDrive/ClinicalNotesGen/Summarization/3_Fine_Tune_LLM/pegasus/pegasus_xsum/lora_1/checkpoints/dialogue-summary-training-2025-06-11_10-26-10/checkpoint-870'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":50}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Load trainer_state.json\n","trainer_state_path = os.path.join(checkpoints_path, \"trainer_state.json\")\n","if os.path.exists(trainer_state_path):\n","    with open(trainer_state_path, \"r\") as f:\n","        trainer_state = json.load(f)\n","    # Print training and evaluation metrics\n","    for log in trainer_state[\"log_history\"]:\n","        step = log.get(\"step\", \"N/A\")\n","        train_loss = log.get(\"loss\", \"N/A\")\n","        eval_loss = log.get(\"eval_loss\", \"N/A\")\n","        print(f\"Step {step}: Train Loss = {train_loss}, Eval Loss = {eval_loss}\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"No trainer_state.json found.
