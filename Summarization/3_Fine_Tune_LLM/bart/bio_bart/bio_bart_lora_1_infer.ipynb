Is that correct?\n","Patient: Yes, doctor.\n","Doctor: We recently conducted a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) before transferring you to the operating theatre for an ABI insertion. During the MRI, your airway was secured with a size 5.5 mm internal-diameter uncuffed ETT. Did you experience any discomfort during the MRI?\n","Patient: No, it was okay.\n","Doctor: Great. Now, during the surgery, we will be performing intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring, which includes brainstem auditory sensory evoked potentials, brainstem mapping of CN IX, X, XI, XII and their motor nuclei, and corticobulbar tract motor-evoked potential (MEP). This will help us monitor your nerves during the procedure.\n","Patient: Okay, doctor.\n","Doctor: Our anesthesia team will be responsible for the lead placement for CN IX, X, XI, XII. We will use a 32 mm by 29 mm laryngeal electrode for CN X monitoring (Fig.). To ensure optimal electrode placement on the tracheal tube, we positioned you as intended for surgery (right lateral) and identified the depth of ETT corresponding to the laryngeal inlet using a C-MAC Laryngoscope.\n","Patient: Hmm, alright.\n","Doctor: This corresponded to 6 cm at vocal cords (15 cm at lips). We then prepared a new #5.5 uncuffed ETT with the laryngeal electrodes (Fig.) and re-intubated you, in keeping with the measurements. \n","Patient: Okay, got it.\n","Doctor: For CN IX placement, we put a pin electrode on the ipsilateral soft palate. For CN XII, we placed electrodes on the anterior tongue. \n","Patient: I see.\n","Doctor: To stabilize the tracheal tube, we used rolled up gauzes on either side of it (Fig.), which also acted as a bite block.\n","Patient: Alright, doctor.\n","Doctor: During the surgery, we will administer Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) which includes propofol (Paedsfusor Target Control Infusion, target plasma concentration 3.5–5.0 mcg/ml) and remifentanil (0.08–0.3 mcg/kg/min).\n","Patient: Will I feel any pain during the surgery?\n","Doctor: No, the anesthesia will ensure that you remain comfortable and pain-free throughout the procedure.\n","Patient: That's good to know.\n","Doctor: After the surgery, we will closely monitor your recovery and provide any necessary follow-up care. It's important that you follow our instructions to ensure the best possible outcome.\n","Patient: Yes, doctor. I will.\n","Doctor: Great. If you or your family have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.\n","Patient: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help.\n","------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","REFERENCE SUMMARY:\n","S: The patient is a 7-year-old boy with congenital bilateral sensorineural deafness, reporting a previously failed right cochlear implant. He denies experiencing discomfort during the recent MRI procedure.\n","O: Recent MRI with airway secured using a 5.5 mm internal-diameter uncuffed ETT. Pre-operative preparations for ABI insertion include intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring and placement of various electrodes for nerve monitoring. The anesthesia plan includes Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol targeted at a plasma concentration of 3.5–5.0 mcg/ml and remifentanil dosed at 0.08–0.3 mcg/kg/min.\n","A: Primary diagnosis is congenital bilateral sensorineural deafness with a failed right cochlear implant. The patient is scheduled for ABI insertion with comprehensive intraoperative monitoring to ensure nerve integrity and anesthesia efficacy.\n","P: Proceed with ABI insertion under TIVA. Monitor intraoperative neurophysiology closely. Post-operative care will include close monitoring of recovery and necessary follow-up care. Educate the patient and family on post-operative care and encourage them to reach out with any concerns or questions.\n","------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","BASE MODEL:\n","In this video, a doctor explains how to insert a cochlear implant in a child with sensorineural deafness.\n","------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","FINE-TUNED MODEL:\n","S: The patient is a 7-year-old boy with congenital bilateral sensorineural deafness and a failed right cochlear implant.

You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what does ok that mean for me?\\nDoctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, let me see you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?\\nDoctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address address the issue. During the the procedure, we well placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.\\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\\nDoctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at uh the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?\\nDoctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that ok it was not necessary to preserve the well ARHD, so as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile bile duct.\\nPatient: So, what was done during during the surgery?\\nDoctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.\\nPatient: How was the ARHD removed?\\nDoctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it let me see using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.\\nPatient: Alright, Alright, thank you for explaining everything to to me. let me see What should I expect during my recovery?\\nDoctor: You will need to follow up with us regularly so we can monitor monitor your you know progress and ensure proper healing.

Besides this, you also have osteoporosis, which causes you to be bent over. so You underwent distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, Yes, that's right. I had the the surgery a long time ago.\\nDoctor: According to your operative so note, the surgery was performed without lymph node dissection. After the retroperitoneal attachments behind the duodenum were dissected, a Billroth I reconstruction was performed. The resected mass was determined to be an aberrant pancreas. I mean\\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\\nDoctor: We uh performed an upper gastrointestinal examination and found the presence of your postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed that esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract were absent, which is good news.\\nPatient: Oh, that's a relief.\\nDoctor: However, enhanced computed tomography tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the mediastinum. The stomach was expanded with food food remaining inside, and it was compressing the heart in the posterior mediastinum.\\nPatient: That sounds serious.\\nDoctor: It is a concern, but fortunately, you have yeah no symptoms of cardiac failure, and your heart function was normal on I mean echocardiography. Preoperative eCT also showed that the right and and left gastric arteries and the gastroepiploic arteries were preserved, which indicates that the distal gastrectomy you know was performed without lymph node dissection.\\nPatient: So what's the next step, doc?\\nDoctor: Based on on your symptoms and the hiatal hernia diagnosis, your dysphagia is quite severe, severe, so we recommend recommend elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia to alleviate your symptoms.\\nPatient: Alright, if that's what's needed.\\nDoctor: During the surgery, a total of five ports will will be placed in your abdomen, abdomen, and a Nathanson liver retractor will be inserted to retract the left liver lobe. A laparoscopic approach will be used to address the slight adhesion of the greater omentum just under the postoperative scar and the little adhesion with the liver and spleen.\\nPatient: Okay, I understand. When will the surgery be scheduled?\\nDoctor: We'll work on scheduling the surgery as soon as possible and inform you of the date. In the meantime, please follow any preoperative instructions provided by our staff, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

Mild elevation in glucose at 121 mg/dL and weakly positive antinuclear antibody at 2.\\nA: Primary diagnosis is branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) in the left eye, likely exacerbated by underlying hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Differential diagnoses could include diabetic retinopathy or other vascular occlusive disorders. The prognosis depends on the management of underlying conditions and response to treatment.\\nP: Plan to monitor blood pressure and glucose levels closely. Initiate or adjust antihypertensive and diabetic medications as needed. Refer to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and possible intravitreal injections or laser therapy for BRVO. Educate patient on the importance of controlling blood pressure and blood sugar levels to prevent progression of ocular and systemic complications. Schedule follow-up in 1 month to reassess condition and treatment efficacy. Encourage patient to report any worsening of symptoms immediately.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"fine_tuned_model_output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"S: The patient, with a history of cholelithiasis and a positive Murphy's sign, reports experiencing pain in the right upper abdomen, which has been bothersome.\\nO: Physical examination revealed a thickened gallbladder wall with a gallstone and surrounding panniculitis. Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media revealed a large gallstone in the wall and a slight increase in the CT value. MRCP confirmed the presence of an aberrant bile duct connected to the cystic duct. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, with four ports placed: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, an epigastric area, a 5-mm port at the right subcostal area, and a right lateral abdomen. Postoperative cholangiography confirmed a patent aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD).\\nA: The primary diagnosis was chronic calculous cholebitis with aberrant aberrant duct flow into the cyst. Differential diagnoses included other causes of gallstone disease and other biliary tract conditions.\\nP: The management plan includes surgical exploration and management of the aberrant hepatic artery and the ARHD. The patient is advised to follow a strict postoperative follow-up schedule. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and monitor any complications. The prognosis is expected to be favorable.\",\n          \"S: The patient, a 58-year-old male, presents with symptoms of dysphagia dysphosia and significant body weight loss over the past 3 months. He has a history of a distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, performed without lymph node dissection.\\nO: Physical examination revealed a height of 158.0 cm and a weight of 53.6 kg, with a BMI of 21.5. Upon admission, the patient was noted to have osteoporosis and bent over. He had undergone a Billroth I reconstruction for an aberrant pancreas resected from the duodenum 40 years previously.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, compressing the heart in the posterior mediastinum. The patient has no symptoms of cardiac failure and normal heart function on echocardiography. Differential diagnoses include other causes of dysphagic symptoms such as esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract.\\nP: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy confirmed the presence of the postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed no esophagogastroduodenal reflux or tumor. Enhanced computed tomography tomography (eCT) revealed a large Hiatal Hernia (HH) involving the stomach with food food remaining inside. Preoperative eCT showed that the right and and left gastric arteries and the gastroepiploic arteries were preserved, indicating that the surgery was without lymphadenectomy.\\nM: The management plan includes surgical resection of the aberrant pancreatic mass and reconstruction of the gastric stump. Postoperative care will include close monitoring of the patient's nutritional status and cardiac function. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient for any complications. The prognosis is expected to be favorable with close follow-ups and close monitoring for any signs of recurrence.\",\n          \"S: The patient reports constant blurry vision in the left eye for about 6 weeks. He has a history of cystic fibrosis, chronic sinusitis, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea. He also has a past history of sinus surgery 7 months ago.\\nO: Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes, intraocular pressure is 18 mm Hg OD and 16 mm OS, and pupils are 4 mm and reactive. Anterior and posterior examinations are unremarkable. Optical coherence tomography reveals intraretinal hemorrhages along the nerve fiber layer with associated retinal thickening in the inferior macula, consistent with a branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). Fluorescein angiogram confirms delayed venous filling of the inferior venous arcade. Blood pressure readings are consistently between 110 and 145 systolic over 70-85 diastolic in the past year. Hemoglobin A1c is 6.9% 4 months prior to presentation. Lab results show normal complete blood cell count, Vitamin A and D levels, prothrombin time, and procalcitonin levels.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is BRVO. Differential diagnoses include other causes of BRVO, such as diabetic retinopathy or other retinal vascular disorders.\\nP: The management plan includes close monitoring of the patient's blood pressure and glycemic control. Regular follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor blood pressure control and monitor blood glucose levels. The patient is advised to continue taking his medications as indicated. Education on the importance of regular monitoring of blood glucose and hemoglobin levels is essential.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":29}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_soap_gens_2 = []\n","\n","for i in range(50, 100):\n","    print(f\"Sample {i}:\")\n","    dialogue = ds[\"test\"][i][\"augmented_dialogue\"]\n","    note = ds[\"test\"][i][\"soap_note\"]\n","\n","    output = get_response(dialogue, note, ft_model)\n","\n","    test_soap_gens_2.append({\n","        'dialogue': dialogue,\n","        'reference_note': note,\n","        'fine_tuned_model_output': output\n","    })\n","\n","test_soap_gens_df_2 = pd.DataFrame(test_soap_gens_2)\n","test_soap_gens_df_2.to_csv(f\"{checkpoints_dir}/test_soap_50_100.csv\", index=False)\n","print(f\"Saved to: {checkpoints_dir}/test_soap_50_100.csv\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"C1zF-LdkDvue","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749630300948,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":422508,"user":{"displayName":"Unforgiven The","userId":"10817091228202119239"}},"outputId":"6897aa5d-0066-4f9e-e010-c2c8e91d6fe5","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['length_penalty'].

Can you please tell me what concerns you have about your skin?\\nPatient: Yeah, I have this brown papule on my upper back, and it's within a large tattoo. I'm not really sure how long it's been there or if it was there when I got the tattoo.\\nDoctor: I see. Let me take a closer look. Hmm, it appears to be an 8-millimeter flat, brown papule. Since we're uncertain about the lesion's initial presentation, pattern of growth, and appearance, I would recommend a shave removal of the lesion to examine it further. How does that sound?\\nPatient: Okay, I guess that sounds fine.\\n[After the shave removal and excision]\\nDoctor: We have examined the original excision, and it showed an atypical intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation. The dermis also contained scattered foci of tattoo pigment and fibrosis. It's important to note that an early evolving melanoma in situ couldn't be excluded at that time.\\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\\nDoctor: Don't worry, we took further action by re-excising the lesion with a 5-millimeter margin. Upon examination, no residual melanocytic lesion was detected, only scar tissue was present. This is a positive sign.\\nPatient: That's a relief. So what's next?\\nDoctor: You have healed well since the excision, and we will continue to monitor your skin to ensure there are no further concerns. It's important to keep an eye on any changes in your skin and report them to us.\\nPatient: Alright, I'll make sure to pay attention to my skin and let you know if I notice anything unusual.\\nDoctor: That's great. Remember, early detection and intervention are key to managing any potential issues. If you have any concerns or questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.\\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care and have a great day!\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 68-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, newly-diagnosed liver cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I. You were admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology service for a planned transvaginal hysterectomy. Can you tell me more about your medical history and any current symptoms you're experiencing?\\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I don't have any history of significant alcohol use, and my viral hepatitis serologies were negative for hepatitis A, B, and C.\\nDoctor: I noticed that your ferritin level was 319 ng/ml, which makes hemochromatosis unlikely. Your anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies were also negative. So, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are unlikely in the absence of other clinical findings. We also considered Wilson's disease, but your serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal, and you did not have any psychiatric symptoms.\\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. I also remember that my \\u03b1-1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mg/dl.\\nDoctor: Based on your medical history, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) seems to be the most probable explanation for your cirrhosis, given that you have type 2 diabetes mellitus, a body mass index (BMI) of 29.83, and hyperlipidemia. However, you've been taking methotrexate for more than 10 years for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, which could also be a contributing factor.\\nPatient: Hmm, I see. So what happened during my preoperative evaluation?\\nDoctor: During the evaluation, your resting supine oxygen saturation was noted to be 93%. At that time, you denied any respiratory or cardiac symptoms, so you underwent the transvaginal hysterectomy, which went smoothly with no complications.\\nPatient: That's good to hear. But I remember feeling short of breath after the surgery.\\nDoctor: Yes, on postoperative day two, you became dyspneic while walking to the restroom. We also noted a two-gram drop in your hemoglobin level after surgery, which was promptly corrected with two units of packed red blood cells.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. Did that help with my shortness of breath?\\nDoctor: Unfortunately, despite the administration of packed red blood cell transfusions, you still experienced hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82% while sitting up and during ambulation. When you tried to ambulate further, you developed perioral cyanosis.\\nPatient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. What should I do now, Doctor?\\nDoctor: We will continue to closely monitor your condition and provide necessary medical support. It's important that you report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. We will work together to ensure your recovery and to manage your various health conditions.\\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, I see you've come in for an outpatient consultation regarding painful right upper thoracic radiculopathy. Can you tell me how long you've been experiencing this pain?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've been dealing with this pain for about 18 months now. It's been pretty bad.\\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain, how would you rate your pain?\\nPatient: I'd say it's around a 7 or 8 out of 10.\\nDoctor: Have you found anything that helps relieve the pain?\\nPatient: Yes, I've been taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and they seem to help.\\nDoctor: Good to know. Do you have any muscle contracture or pain when I press on the area?\\nPatient: No, I don't have any contracture, and it doesn't hurt when you press on it.\\nDoctor: Can you show me exactly where the pain is located?\\nPatient: It's about 3 cm from the thoracic midline on the right side, and I feel some intercostal irradiation too.\\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. Based on the radiographs we took, we didn't find any osteolysis or deformity. However, the MRI showed a T2 hypersignal and a T1 hyposignal at the medial side of your right T1 vertebra, along with inflammation of the right T1 root. The radioisotope bone scanning also revealed lateral hyperfixation on the right side of your T1 vertebra.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\\nDoctor: The CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of your right T1 pedicle. The lesion is close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve, which is causing the inflammation and pain you're experiencing. The aspect of the lesion is compatible with a condition called osteoid osteoma.\\nPatient: What can be done about it?\\nDoctor: Our team recommends a surgical resection using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance. Because the lesion is so close to the dura mater, we cannot perform radiofrequency ablation, which would require thermal ablation. The surgery should be safe and complete, with no risk of recurrence. We'll also make sure to preserve the vertebral stability without needing screw fixation.\\nPatient: What should I expect during the surgery?\\nDoctor: You'll be in a prone position under general anesthesia. We'll use a new all-in-one imaging device called Surgivisio\\u00ae to control the vertebral level in two-dimensional (2D) mode. This machine is a 2D/3D C-arm designed to be combined with surgical navigation. We'll perform a mini-open posterior approach at the C7-T2 levels.\\nPatient: Thank you for explaining all of this to me. I feel more comfortable knowing what to expect.\\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to make the procedure as smooth and successful as possible.

Initial excision biopsy indicated atypical intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation with scattered foci of tattoo pigment and fibrosis in the dermis. A subsequent re-excision with a 5-mm margin showed no residual melanocytic lesion, only scar tissue.\\nA: The primary diagnosis was a suspicious melanocytic lesion, with a differential diagnosis of early evolving melanoma in situ, which could not be excluded initially. The absence of a melanocytic lesion in the re-excised sample suggests successful removal of the atypical cells.\\nP: The patient will undergo regular skin monitoring to detect any new changes or recurrence.

Her BMI is 29.83. Preoperative resting supine oxygen saturation was 93%. Postoperatively, she experienced a drop in hemoglobin by two grams, corrected with two units of packed red blood cells. Despite this, she developed hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82% while sitting up and during ambulation, and perioral cyanosis on further ambulation.\\nA: Primary diagnosis is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, potentially exacerbated by long-term methotrexate use. Postoperative complications include significant hypoxemia and potential anemia. Differential diagnoses for her respiratory symptoms could include pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or pneumonia.\\nP: Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and hemoglobin levels. Consider further diagnostic workup for postoperative respiratory distress, including chest X-ray and possibly a CT pulmonary angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism. Ensure adequate oxygenation and consider respiratory support if hypoxemia persists. Educate the patient on the importance of reporting new or worsening symptoms. Manage underlying chronic conditions with appropriate medications and lifestyle modifications.

Differential diagnoses were considered but ruled out based on imaging studies.\\nP: The management plan includes surgical resection of the osteoid osteoma using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance, specifically using the Surgivisio\\u00ae system for intraoperative navigation. Radiofrequency ablation is contraindicated due to the proximity of the lesion to critical structures. The patient will be positioned prone under general anesthesia, and a mini-open posterior approach at the C7-T2 levels will be performed.

Subsequent excision showed a 5-millimeter margin lesion with no residual melanocytic lesion. Scar tissue was detected, but no residual melanocytic lesion was detected. A: The primary diagnosis is a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, likely due to the presence of a melanocytic lesion. Differential diagnoses could include other skin cancers, but these are less likely given the current diagnosis. P: The management plan includes close monitoring of the patient's skin and regular follow-up appointments to assess for any new or recurring skin concerns. The patient is advised to pay attention to the skin and report any changes. Further education on the importance of early detection and management of skin issues is provided.\",\n          \"S: The patient is a 68-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, newly-diagnosed liver cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I. She reports experiencing dyspneic shortness of breath after surgery, which was corrected with two units of packed red blood cells. She has a history of significant alcohol use, no significant alcohol use history, and no viral hepatitis serologies. O: The patient's ferritin level was 319 ng/ml, with negative anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies. Serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal. -1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mg/dl. Postoperatively, the patient experienced hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82%. A: The primary diagnosis is liver cirrhosis, likely caused by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), with secondary causes including rheumatoid arthritis and hyperlipidemia. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of liver disease, but these are less likely given the patient's history and current symptoms. P: The management plan includes monitoring the patient's blood sugar levels and electrolytes closely. The patient will be advised to continue methotrexate therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and hyperlipidemia. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess the patient's recovery and manage any complications. The patient will be educated on the importance of reporting any new symptoms or concerns immediately.\",\n          \"S: The patient reports experiencing painful right upper thoracic radiculopathy for 18 months. The patient has been taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which alleviate the pain. No muscle contracture or pain is reported. O: Physical examination revealed a 3 cm area from the thoracic midline on the right side of the patient's right T1 vertebra, with intercostal irradiation. MRI and radioisotope bone scanning confirmed T2 hypersignal and T1 hyposignal at the medial side of the right T1 vertebra, inflammation of the right T1 root, and lateral hyperfixation on the right side of the T1 vertebra. CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of the right T1 pedicle. The lesion is close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve, which is causing inflammation and pain. A: The primary diagnosis is osteoid osteoma, a complex condition involving osteoid bone, dura mater, and T1 spinal nerve. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of radiculopathy, but these are less likely given the location and extent of the lesion. P: The management plan includes surgical resection of the osteolytic lesion, which is recommended using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance. The patient will be in a prone position under general anesthesia. The patient will be monitored closely for any complications or complications. The patient will be advised to report any new symptoms or concerns immediately.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":57}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Check loss"],"metadata":{"id":"Pc8VflhJawP_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["checkpoints_path"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52},"id":"76jETADAVrOu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750260411839,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Unforgiven The","userId":"10817091228202119239"}},"outputId":"a28d1674-f065-4318-86b0-bc6b1a0bc5eb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'/content/drive/MyDrive/ClinicalNotesGen/Summarization/3_Fine_Tune_LLM/pegasus/pegasus_pubmed/lora_1/checkpoints/dialogue-summary-training-2025-06-18_21-25-29/checkpoint-870'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":52}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Load trainer_state.json\n","trainer_state_path = os.path.join(checkpoints_path, \"trainer_state.json\")\n","if os.path.exists(trainer_state_path):\n","    with open(trainer_state_path, \"r\") as f:\n","        trainer_state = json.load(f)\n","    # Print training and evaluation metrics\n","    for log in trainer_state[\"log_history\"]:\n","        step = log.get(\"step\", \"N/A\")\n","        train_loss = log.get(\"loss\", \"N/A\")\n","        eval_loss = log.get(\"eval_loss\", \"N/A\")\n","        print(f\"Step {step}: Train Loss = {train_loss}, Eval Loss = {eval_loss}\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"No trainer_state.json found.
