Can you tell me more about the pain um you're experiencing on your right side?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having this pain in my right upper abdomen, and it's been quite bothersome.\\nDoctor: Hmm, it sounds like you may have a positive Murphy's sign. You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what does ok that mean for me?\\nDoctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, let me see you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?\\nDoctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address address the issue. During the the procedure, we well placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.\\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\\nDoctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at uh the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?\\nDoctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that ok it was not necessary to preserve the well ARHD, so as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile bile duct.\\nPatient: So, what was done during during the surgery?\\nDoctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.\\nPatient: How was the ARHD removed?\\nDoctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it let me see using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.\\nPatient: Alright, Alright, thank you for explaining everything to to me. let me see What should I expect during my recovery?\\nDoctor: You will need to follow up with us regularly so we can monitor monitor your you know progress and ensure proper healing. Make sure to follow any post-operative instructions and contact us if you experience any unusual symptoms or concerns.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, thank you for coming in today.

I've noted that your height is 158.0 cm and your current weight is 53.6 kg. Upon admission, your body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 21.5. Besides this, you also have osteoporosis, which causes you to be bent over. so You underwent distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, Yes, that's right. I had the the surgery a long time ago.\\nDoctor: According to your operative so note, the surgery was performed without lymph node dissection. After the retroperitoneal attachments behind the duodenum were dissected, a Billroth I reconstruction was performed. The resected mass was determined to be an aberrant pancreas. I mean\\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\\nDoctor: We uh performed an upper gastrointestinal examination and found the presence of your postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed that esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract were absent, which is good news.\\nPatient: Oh, that's a relief.\\nDoctor: However, enhanced computed tomography tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the mediastinum. The stomach was expanded with food food remaining inside, and it was compressing the heart in the posterior mediastinum.\\nPatient: That sounds serious.\\nDoctor: It is a concern, but fortunately, you have yeah no symptoms of cardiac failure, and your heart function was normal on I mean echocardiography. Preoperative eCT also showed that the right and and left gastric arteries and the gastroepiploic arteries were preserved, which indicates that the distal gastrectomy you know was performed without lymph node dissection.\\nPatient: So what's the next step, doc?\\nDoctor: Based on on your symptoms and the hiatal hernia diagnosis, your dysphagia is quite severe, severe, so we recommend recommend elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia to alleviate your symptoms.\\nPatient: Alright, if that's what's needed.\\nDoctor: During the surgery, a total of five ports will will be placed in your abdomen, abdomen, and a Nathanson liver retractor will be inserted to retract the left liver lobe. A laparoscopic approach will be used to address the slight adhesion of the greater omentum just under the postoperative scar and the little adhesion with the liver and spleen.\\nPatient: Okay, I understand. When will the surgery be scheduled?\\nDoctor: We'll work on scheduling the surgery as soon as possible and inform you of the date. In the meantime, please follow any preoperative instructions provided by our staff, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

Can you tell me more about the pain um you're experiencing on your right side?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having this pain in my right upper abdomen, and it's been quite bothersome.\\nDoctor: Hmm, it sounds like you may have a positive Murphy's sign. You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what does ok that mean for me?\\nDoctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, let me see you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?\\nDoctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address address the issue. During the the procedure, we well placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.\\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\\nDoctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at uh the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.\\nPatient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?\\nDoctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that ok it was not necessary to preserve the well ARHD, so as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile bile duct.\\nPatient: So, what was done during during the surgery?\\nDoctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.\\nPatient: How was the ARHD removed?\\nDoctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it let me see using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.\\nPatient: Alright, Alright, thank you for explaining everything to to me. let me see What should I expect during my recovery?\\nDoctor: You will need to follow up with us regularly so we can monitor monitor your you know progress and ensure proper healing. Make sure to follow any post-operative instructions and contact us if you experience any unusual symptoms or concerns.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been I mean admitted to our hospital with symptoms of of dysphagia dysphagia and uh significant body weight loss over the past 3 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\\nPatient: Yeah, I've had trouble swallowing and I lost around 10 kg in the the past 3 months. It's ok been really tough.\\nDoctor: I see. I've noted that your height is 158.0 cm and your current weight is 53.6 kg. Upon admission, your body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 21.5. Besides this, you also have osteoporosis, which causes you to be bent over. so You underwent distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, Yes, that's right. I had the the surgery a long time ago.\\nDoctor: According to your operative so note, the surgery was performed without lymph node dissection. After the retroperitoneal attachments behind the duodenum were dissected, a Billroth I reconstruction was performed. The resected mass was determined to be an aberrant pancreas. I mean\\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\\nDoctor: We uh performed an upper gastrointestinal examination and found the presence of your postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed that esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract were absent, which is good news.\\nPatient: Oh, that's a relief.\\nDoctor: However, enhanced computed tomography tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the mediastinum.
