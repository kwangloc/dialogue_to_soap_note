Patient: Hi, I don't have any past medical history.
Doctor: Okay. What brings you in today?
Patient: I've been experiencing painless blurry vision in my my right eye for a week now. I've also had intermittent fevers, headache, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on my lower legs for the past 6 months.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Have you had any other symptoms such as neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, Raynaud's phenomenon, oral ulcerations, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity? photosensitivity?
Patient: No, only an isolated episode of left knee swelling and testicular swelling in the past.
Doctor: Do you work with any toxic yeah substances or have any habits like smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use?
Patient: No, I work as a flooring installer and I don't have any toxic habits.
Doctor: Alright. We checked your vital signs and they like were normal. During the physical exam, we found bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema in your right eye, which was greater than than in your left eye. You also have a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect and a right afferent pupillary defect. Your muscle strength and reflexes were normal, and your sensation to so light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception was intact. We also noticed the maculopapular rash um on your bilateral lower extremities.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Your admitting labs showed some abnormal results. You have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 11.6 11.6 gm/dL, hematocrit of 35.3%, and mean corpuscular volume of 76.9 fL. You also have hyponatremia with a sodium level of 133 133 mmol/L. Your erythrocyte like sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated at 33 mm/hr, and your C-reactive C-reactive protein (CRP) is also elevated at at 13.3 mg/L. Your urinalysis did not show any protein or blood.
Patient: Okay. What does that mean?
Doctor: These results could indicate an underlying inflammatory or infectious process. We also performed a lumbar lumbar puncture, which showed clear and colorless fluid, 2 red blood cells per microliter, and 56 white white blood cells per microliter.
Patient: So, you know what's the next step?
Doctor: We need to investigate further to determine the the cause of your symptoms. We'll run additional tests and consult with a specialist to get a clearer understanding of your condition.

"Doctor: Hello, we've received your results from the ultrasound ok we performed in April 2017. It seems that there is a single thyroid nodule present in your left lobe, measuring 1 cm in its largest diameter. We also performed a complete biochemical screening, including tests for TSH, autoantibodies, and calcitonin.
Patient: Hmm, what what did the screening results show, doctor?
Doctor: Your calcitonin level was found you know to be slightly elevated at 40 ng/mL, which is above the normal range of 1-4.8 ng/mL. To further investigate, we performed a stimulation test with intravenous calcium.
Patient: And what did the stimulation test show?
Doctor: After the stimulation, your calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ng/mL, which indicates that surgical treatment is necessary. As a result, you underwent a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection on the side of the tumor.
Patient: Yes, Yes, I remember that. How How was my recovery after the surgery?
Doctor: Your like postoperative course was uneventful, uneventful, with with only a slight hypocalcemia recorded in the first day. However, it completely recovered 48 hours I mean after the surgery, and you were discharged.
Patient: That's good to hear. What did the tests on the removed tissue show?
Doctor: Immunohistochemistry performed on the thyroid nodule revealed the presence of a medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) measuring 1 cm. It is composed of cells with an eosinophilic cytoplasm and has a predominantly expansive growth pattern. A histological examination showed that the tumor cells were positive for calcitonin, Cromogranin A, Synaptofisin, and TTF-1, so but negative for the presence of amyloid.
Patient: What about the other surrounding tissue?
Doctor: Focal foci of C-cells hyperplasia were spread throughout the entire gland. However, none of the lymph nodes in the central compartment showed any signs of metastases.
Patient: That's a relief. What other tests were done on the tissue?
Doctor: To perform a more detailed analysis, we treated formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections with antigen retrieval using citrate buffer at high pH. They were then immunolabeled with a rabbit monoclonal anti-calcitonin antibody and incubated with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies.
Patient: So, what does this all mean for my condition?

Patient: It's been a little bit better with the fentanyl, but it's still quite painful.
Doctor: I see. In addition to the fentanyl, we have also administered a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid to help alleviate the pancreatitis and your abdominal pain. We have gradually reduced the continuous fentanyl I mean infusion, and it was discontinued after reaching 240 μg/day (10% of the maximum dose). However, you you mentioned experiencing nausea/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. It was pretty uncomfortable.
Doctor: I apologize for for the discomfort. To alleviate these symptoms, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion at 240 μg/day, and the symptoms disappeared. However, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced, so we decided to initiate a transdermal fentanyl patch to so taper the opioid more slowly. How has that been working for you?
Patient: The patch has been helpful; I've um noticed a difference.
Doctor: Good to hear. Unfortunately, your pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later. Therefore, we resumed resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion and titrated it to 600 μg/day. We have been gradually decreasing decreasing the the dose daily (600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 μg/day).

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing some pain in my right chest lately.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your background? Are you a smoker?
Patient: No, I am a non-smoker. I work as an engineer for a a gas company.
Doctor: Alright. Have you had any exposure to asbestos in your workplace?
Patient: No, I don't think so.
Doctor: Let's perform a physical examination to check for any issues in your lungs. [After ok examination] I noticed a reduction of lung sounds at the right lung basis, but no clinical sign let me see of autoimmune disease.
Patient: Hmm, so what could could be causing the chest pain pain then?
Doctor: We will need to perform a chest X-ray (CXR) to investigate further. [After CXR] The results show a I mean considerable reduction reduction in the right lung volume with associated right pleural effusion.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means there is fluid around your right lung. We should perform more more tests to determine the cause. [After uh tests] All serological, autoimmune, and microbiological tests came back negative. Let's do a computed tomography (CT) scan to get a better view. [After CT] The CT scan revealed a slight reduction in right lung volume with associated right pleural effusion and pleural thickening.
Patient: What's the next step?
Doctor: We will conduct a supplemental investigation to rule out any history of trauma, tuberculosis, and pneumothorax. We will also perform an echocardiography to exclude pulmonary hypertension, and a diaphragm I mean dysfunction test through phrenic nerve stimulation. [After investigations] All tests were negative.
Doctor: We'll proceed with a total body positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) to let me see check for any abnormalities. [After PET-CT] There was a low-intensity hyper-accumulation of 18-FDG in the right pleura with with so increased concentration concentration in the basal, middle, and posterior pleural surface.
Patient: What's the next step, then?
Doctor: We'll perform a surgical lung biopsy (SLB) to identify the uh issue. [After well SLB] The biopsy identified non-specific fibrinous pleurisy, but the search for neoplastic or infectious cells was negative.
Doctor: Unfortunately, your forced vital capacity (FVC) has dropped significantly over the previous 3 years, and you have developed shortness of breath on exertion. I am going to prescribe a prednisolone course to help with the symptoms. ok

He denied any exposure to asbestos and any history of smoking. The patient also mentioned a significant drop in forced vital capacity over the past three years and recent development of shortness of breath on exertion.
O: Physical examination revealed reduced lung sounds at the right lung base. Chest X-ray indicated a considerable reduction in right lung volume with associated right pleural effusion. CT scan confirmed these findings and also showed pleural thickening. Serological, autoimmune, and microbiological tests were negative. PET-CT showed low-intensity hyper-accumulation of 18-FDG in the right pleura. Surgical lung biopsy identified non-specific fibrinous pleurisy without neoplastic or infectious cells. The patient's condition progressed to restrictive respiratory failure.
A: The primary diagnosis is non-specific fibrinous pleurisy with associated pleural effusion and pleural thickening, leading to restrictive respiratory failure. Differential diagnoses such as mesothelioma, tuberculosis, and pneumothorax were ruled out through various investigations. The prognosis became poor as the patient developed restrictive respiratory failure and subsequently suffered a fatal cardiac ischemic attack.

She denies any visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, or other neurological symptoms. Her medical history includes a previous pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia and delivery of a growth-restricted fetus. She also has a history of infrarenal aortic stenosis diagnosed postpartum, persistent hypertension, and intermittent claudication. Her regular medications include aspirin 100 mg and calcium 1.2 g daily. Family history is significant for paternal ischemic heart disease and maternal hypertension.
O: Past investigations revealed 75% stenosis of the infrarenal aorta on computed tomographic angiogram. Recent laboratory tests during pregnancy showed low-grade proteinuria with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 40 mg/mmol, normal renal and liver function, a C-reactive protein level of 3.8 mg/L, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 16 mm/h, and absence of antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and antiphospholipid antibodies. Ultrasound at 34 weeks indicated an estimated fetal weight in the 94th percentile with normal placental vascular resistance.
A: The primary diagnosis is significant infrarenal aortic stenosis with differential diagnoses including congenital abdominal coarctation, Takayasu's arteritis, fibromuscular dysplasia, aortic neurofibromatosis, aortic tuberculosis, and radiation aortitis. The presence of well-developed collateral vasculature suggests a chronic aortopathy, likely due to congenital abdominal aortic coarctation, fibromuscular dysplasia, or an inactive form of Takayasu's arteritis.

Doctor: Hmm, it sounds like you may have a positive Murphy's sign. You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.
Patient: Oh, I see. So what does ok that mean for me?
Doctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, let me see you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.
Patient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?
Doctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address address the issue. During the the procedure, we well placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.
Patient: How did the surgery go?
Doctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at uh the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.
Patient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?
Doctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that ok it was not necessary to preserve the well ARHD, so as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile bile duct.
Patient: So, what was done during during the surgery?
Doctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.
Patient: How was the ARHD removed?
Doctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it let me see using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.

Patient: Yes, I came in with a strangulated large bowel and ventral hernia, 10 years after my LAGB procedure.
Doctor: That's correct. At that time, you were still morbidly obese and had been lost to so follow-up. We performed an emergency surgical hernia repair, which included resection of the necrotic transverse colon, and created a loop ileostomy. One year later, you presented with with a LAGB port-site infection. Do you remember what we like did during that time? ok
Patient: Yes, you removed the port and sutured the tubing to my abdominal wall.
Doctor: Exactly. During both admissions, we we observed the LAGB tubing in a stable position adjacent to the transverse colon on the CT scans, with no concerns for penetration. Six months after the port-site infection, we elected to reverse the ileostomy. However, there were complications in the early post-operative period. Can you tell me about those symptoms?
Patient: I remember feeling really sick and ended up having abdominal sepsis.
Doctor: Yes, that's correct. The abdominal yeah CT demonstrated transection of the remaining proximal transverse colon by the LAGB tubing. Due to let me see this, we had to perform a right hemicolectomy, which involved the removal yeah of the gastric band and tubing, and we created an end ileostomy.

Patient: What did the skin biopsy show?
Doctor: The biopsy demonstrated a cup-shaped depression of the epidermis associated with a keratin plug containing compact ortho- and parakeratosis with granular nuclear debris. Altered collagen fibers were seen in the let me see underlying dermis, with focal extrusion through the epidermis. Based on these clinical and yeah histological findings, you were diagnosed with acquired reactive perforating collagenosis (ARPC).
Patient: Was this caused by the injections?
Doctor: Yes, we performed a challenge test, which indicated that the rash and pruritus started after the injections. Unfortunately, you had a poor response to topical steroids to treat the rash.
Patient: What's the next step for treatment?
Doctor: We will proceed with 22 sessions of NBUVB therapy to help alleviate your symptoms. Please continue to monitor your vision and let us know if you experience any changes or worsening symptoms.","S: The patient, with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease, reports bilateral vision loss. He is currently on multiple medications including klopidogrel, ramipril, amlodipine, atorvastatin, gliclazide, and metformin. He has experienced improvement in vision in the right eye from 20/32 to 20/25 after three monthly intravitreal RAN injections. Additionally, he reports a worsening generalized, pruriginous skin eruption post-injection.
O: Fundus fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography revealed ciliary artery occlusion in the left eye with a visual acuity of 20/200, and an occult choroidal neovascular membrane with subretinal fluid in the right eye. Central macular thickness has decreased. Laboratory tests showed mild hyperlipidemia with cholesterol at 241 mg/dl (normal <200 mg/dl) and triglycerides at 256 mg/dl (normal <150 mg/dl). Blood glucose was 155 mg/dl and HbA1C was 6.6%. Dermatological examination revealed a generalized, erythematous rash with umblicated papules. Skin biopsy indicated acquired reactive perforating collagenosis (ARPC).
A: Primary diagnosis of ARPC, likely induced by intravitreal RAN injections, with secondary complications of mild hyperlipidemia and poorly controlled diabetes. The patient's vision improvement in the right eye is encouraging, but the left eye remains significantly impaired.
P: Continue monitoring vision and adjust intravitreal treatment as necessary while managing ARPC with 22 sessions of NBUVB therapy. Address hyperlipidemia and diabetes control through medication adjustment and dietary consultation. Regular follow-ups in ophthalmology and dermatology are recommended to monitor progress and manage side effects.","S: The patient, a patient with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease, presents with bilateral vision loss.

"Doctor: Hi there, I see you've presented with a history of right knee I mean pain for a 3-month duration. Can you tell me if you've experienced any trauma or undue exercise recently?
Patient: No, I haven't had any trauma or done any any excessive excessive exercise.
Doctor: Alright, let me do a physical examination. I've noticed joint effusion and a limited range of motion in your right knee. Have you experienced any locking in the joint or felt a palpable mass?
Patient: No, there's no locking or um any mass that I can feel.
Doctor: And like do you have any well other significant past history that I should be aware of?
Patient: No, I don't have any like other significant past history.
Doctor: I see that you haven't received any conservative treatments or plain x-radiography. Based on an MRI of your right knee, there's an intra-articular lesion located around the posterior cruciate ligament. The lesion shows iso-intensity or lower intensity compared to surrounding muscle in T1 weighted MRIs, and high signal intensity in T2 weighted MRIs (Fig. ). The preoperative differential diagnoses could be synovial chondromatosis, pigmented villonodular synovitis, or malignant soft tissue tumour.
Patient: Oh, I see. What's the next step, then?
Doctor: We're planning to perform an arthroscopy arthroscopy operation to remove the lesion and obtain a biopsy to test for malignant soft tissue tumour. If it's positive for malignancy, additional wide extra-articular resection would be needed, and artificial joints were prepared.
Patient: Alright, what happened during the arthroscopy?
Doctor: During the arthroscopy of your right knee, we found synovial hyperplasia inflammation and the mass in front of the right posterior cruciate ligament (Fig. ). We excised the lesion and and performed a partial synovectomy.
Patient: What were the findings uh of the biopsy?
Doctor: Macroscopically, the right knee mass was a piece of grey-red tissue measuring 2.5 2.5 cm by 2 cm by 1 cm in size. The antibodies, clones, dilutions, pretreatment conditions, and sources are listed in Table . On On microscopic examination (Fig. ), the tumour consisted of a bland fibroblastic fibroblastic proliferation arranged arranged in irregular fasciitis with tissue-culture-like appearance. The stroma varied from focally myxoid with microcyst formation to collagenous. Extravasated erythrocytes and small lymphocytes were were present throughout the lesion. No areas of necrosis or atypical mitosis were seen.
Patient: What about the immunohistochemistry results?
Doctor: Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the cells were positive positive in patches for SMA and negative for S100, desmin, CK(AE1/AE3), and nuclear (Fig. ).
Patient: So, what does all this mean for I mean me?
Doctor: Based on these findings, it appears that the lesion is not malignant, which is good news. We will continue to monitor your recovery and let you know if any additional treatments or follow-ups are needed. Be sure to report any changes in your symptoms or new concerns.
