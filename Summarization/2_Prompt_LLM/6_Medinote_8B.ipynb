And how long have you been pregnant?\n","Patient: I am 22 weeks pregnant.\n","Doctor: Okay, and do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of?\n","Patient: Yes, I have mild Multiple Sclerosis, but I am asymptomatic.\n","Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?\n","Patient: No, I don't smoke or drink alcohol.\n","Doctor: Great. Have you ever used corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, or anticoagulants?\n","Patient: No, I haven't.\n","Doctor: Okay, and are you taking any other medications currently?\n","Patient: No, I am not taking any other medication.\n","Doctor: Alright, let me perform a clinical examination. (After examination) Based on the examination, everything seems to be normal. We will not perform any investigations at this stage. Our working diagnosis is non-specific hip pain related to pregnancy. We will provide you with supportive measures.\n","Patient: Okay.\n","Doctor: Over the next few weeks, if your pain worsens or you experience pain in your other hip, please let us know.\n","Patient: I will, thank you.\n","Doctor: By 36 weeks of pregnancy, you were unable to weight bear, correct?\n","Patient: Yes, that's correct. I was unable to weight bear and I had to use a wheelchair.\n","Doctor: I see. The pain in your hips and the limitation of motion made it impossible for you to have a normal vaginal delivery, correct?\n","Patient: Yes, that's correct. I had to have a caesarean delivery.\n","Doctor: Okay, and your baby was healthy and full term, correct?\n","Patient: Yes, my baby was healthy and full term.\n","Doctor: Great. After delivery, we performed radiographs and they revealed a displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture on the left and a valgus impacted right intracapsular femoral neck fracture on the right. We also found considerable osteopaenia.\n","Patient: Okay.\n","Doctor: We then performed a closed reduction and internal fixation of the left hip and the right hip was internally fixed in situ. We used two-hole 135 degree dynamic hip screws to provide stability and allow immediate mobilization.\n","Patient: Okay.\n","Doctor: We encountered some difficulty in ensuring that the threads of the dynamic hip screw had crossed the fracture site in the left hip as the level of the fracture was high in the femoral neck. Consequently, the tip of the implant had to be implanted close to the subchondral plate.\n","Patient: Okay, I understand.\n","\"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"wqIfmI1LKNSW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749113072162,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Unforgiven The","userId":"10817091228202119239"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dialogue"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"id":"Bds9Ku4RV3TQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749114387588,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Unforgiven The","userId":"10817091228202119239"}},"outputId":"e8cd7179-a756-45ae-f756-9cfa0719311a"},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"\\nDoctor: Good morning, what brings you here today?\\nPatient: Hello, I'm here because I have been having pain in my left hip for a few weeks now.\\nDoctor: I see.

How are you feeling today?\n","Patient: Good morning, doctor. I’m feeling okay.\n","Doctor: That’s good to hear. Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?\n","Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with pleomorphic soft tissue sarcoma of the scalp in 2013.\n","Doctor: I see. And what happened after that?\n","Patient: I had three resections between 2013 and 2015, but the lesion kept coming back.\n","Doctor: Hmm, I see. And what happened next?\n","Patient: In 2015, I noticed an enlarging mass behind my left ear.\n","Doctor: Okay, and what did the CT scan show?\n","Patient: The CT scan documented a 2 cm mass that was related to my parotid gland.\n","Doctor: I see. And what was the result of the needle aspiration?\n","Patient: The needle aspiration thought it was a recurrence of my sarcoma.\n","Doctor: I see. And what was the result of the biopsy?\n","Patient: The biopsy reported it was a high-grade malignant spindle cell neoplasm consistent with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.\n","Doctor: Hmm, I see. And what was the result of the PET/CT?\n","Patient: The PET/CT showed three hypermetabolic nodules in my lungs, which was consistent with metastatic disease.\n","Doctor: I see. And what happened after that?\n","Patient: I was referred to radiation oncology for palliative radiotherapy to the postauricular lesion because I declined surgery due to my age and medical comorbidities.\n","Doctor: I see. And what was the result of the treatment?\n","Patient: I received a course of 3D conformal external beam radiation to a dose of 40 Gy in eight fractions using electrons. The treatment was very well tolerated with only Grade 1 skin erythema.\n","Doctor: That’s great to hear. And what happened after that?\n","Patient: I was seen by medical oncology to discuss chemotherapy options, but systemic therapy was not offered due to my medical comorbidities and low response rate with this histology.\n","Doctor: I see. And how was your two-month post-treatment follow-up?\n","Patient: My clinical exam and restaging CT neck soft tissue showed complete tumor response without residual disease in the irradiated left postauricular region. And my computed tomography chest images showed a dramatic improvement.\n","Doctor: That’s great to hear. I’m glad to see that you’re doing well.

He underwent three resections between 2013 and 2015 with local recurrence of the lesion. In 2015, the patient noticed an enlarging mass behind his left ear. A CT scan documented a 2 cm mass related to the left parotid gland. A fine needle aspiration thought it was a recurrence of his sarcoma. A biopsy was performed and reported it was a high-grade malignant spindle cell neoplasm consistent with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. A positron emission tomography (PET)/CT in February 2016 showed three hypermetabolic nodules in the lung consistent with metastatic disease. The largest nodule in the left lower lobe measured 1.6 cm with a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 9.3. The patient was referred to radiation oncology for palliative radiotherapy to the postauricular lesion as he declined surgery due to his age and medical comorbidities. He was also seen by medical oncology to discuss chemotherapy options, but systemic therapy was not offered due to medical comorbidities and low response rate with this histology.\n","The patient received a course of 3D conformal external beam radiation to a dose of 40 Gy in eight fractions using electrons (Figure ). The treatment was very well tolerated with only Grade 1 skin erythema. He was seen by medical oncology following completion of radiation therapy to discuss further systemic therapy options. Due to the lack of response to chemotherapy with this histology and low response rate with systemic therapy in general, no systemic therapy was offered.\n","At his two-month post-treatment follow-up, his clinical exam and restaging CT neck soft tissue showed complete tumor response without residual disease in the irradiated left postauricular region. His computed tomography (CT) chest images at that time showed a dramatic improvement in the bilateral pulmonary nodules (Figures , ). The largest left pulmonary nodule measured 1.1 cm with an SUV of 2.3, down from 9.3 prior to radiation therapy. The patient remains clinically disease free 17 months following completion of radiation therapy.\n","Figure . CT chest with metastatic pulmonary nodules prior to radiation therapy.\n","Figure .

He underwent three resections between 2013 and 2015 with local recurrence of the lesion. In 2015, the patient noticed an enlarging mass behind his left ear. A CT scan documented a 2 cm mass related to the left parotid gland. A fine needle aspiration thought it was a recurrence of his sarcoma. A biopsy was performed and reported it was a high-grade malignant spindle cell neoplasm consistent with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. A positron emission tomography (PET)/CT in February 2016 showed three hypermetabolic nodules in the lung consistent with metastatic disease. The largest nodule in the left lower lobe measured 1.6 cm with a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 9.3. The patient was referred to radiation oncology for palliative radiotherapy to the postauricular lesion as he declined surgery due to his age and medical comorbidities. He was also seen by medical oncology to discuss chemotherapy options, but systemic therapy was not offered due to medical comorbidities and low response rate with this histology.\n","The patient received a course of 3D conformal external beam radiation to a dose of 40 Gy in eight fractions using electrons (Figure ). The treatment was very well tolerated with only Grade 1 skin erythema. He was seen by medical oncology following completion of radiation therapy to discuss further systemic therapy options. Due to the lack of response to chemotherapy with this histology and low response rate with systemic therapy in general, no systemic therapy was offered.\n","At his two-month post-treatment follow-up, his clinical exam and restaging CT neck soft tissue showed complete tumor response without residual disease in the irradiated left postauricular region. His computed tomography (CT) chest images at that time showed a dramatic improvement in the bilateral pulmonary nodules (Figures , ). The largest left pulmonary nodule measured 1.1 cm with an SUV of 2.3, down from 9.3 prior to radiation therapy.
