S: The patient reports a progressive headache, nausea, and vomiting for about a week. He also noticed right-side weakness, ptosis, and diplopia. He reports an acute onset conscious disturbance, and his Glasgow Coma Scale was E3VaM5. O: Brain computed tomography revealed an enhanced brain tumor with necrotic cystic changes. The tumor is located in the left temporal lobe with upward extension to the left basal ganglion and peri-optic region, causing perifocal edema and midline shift. Post-operatively, the patient underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Subsequent brain MRIs showed a new enhanced lesion at the left temporal base, with a maximum of 3.0 cm in diameter. Histologically, the oligodendroglial component was identified, with IDH1 positivity, diffuse p53 positivity, and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase negativity. Neoplastic cells showed isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 positivity, diffuse p53 positivity, and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase negativity. A: The primary diagnosis is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with associated intracranial pressure and a positive PNET-like component. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of brain cancer, but these are less likely given the current clinical status and the patient's history. P: Continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly based on the current status and clinical response. Educate the patient on the importance of regular follow-up appointments and follow-up. Educate the patient on the importance of reporting any new symptoms or changes in symptoms.
