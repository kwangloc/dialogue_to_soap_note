Another thing that can happen is because there's so much sugar being moved all the time into the cells, the cells sort of stop paying attention to insulin anyway. So even if we do make some insulin, it doesn't really do its job properly anymore. Wow. Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay.

And then when we move on to thinking about the longer term complications, it causes problems because the glucose going round and round in the blood damages the blood vessels. So there's a selection of small blood vessels and some bigger blood vessels that that causes problems for. So in the small blood vessels, they're the blood vessels that are found behind the eyes and the blood vessels that supply the nerves to the fingers and toes. And also the blood vessels in the kidneys are quite small as well. Okay.

That's probably to make sure that he wasn't getting those complications of diabetes.
